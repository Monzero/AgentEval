Additionally, the company's commitment to providing a safe and respectful workplace is emphasized through clear and fair disciplinary procedures. While there is no separate policy dedicated solely to occupational health and safety, the 'Tata Code of Conduct 2015' clearly outlines the company's commitment to workplace safety as a core principle. Furthermore, Tata Motors provides health, safety, and sexual harassment training to its employees. The only limitation noted is that these policies do not explicitly cover supplier/vendor health, safety, and welfare.

Moreover, the Annual Report (Page 141) mentions that Tata Motors has a 'Policy on Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal of sexual harassment at workplace' with zero tolerance for sexual harassment. The report also provides information on the number of complaints received and closed during FY24, indicating transparency in addressing sexual harassment incidents.

2025-02-26 21:09:28,TATAMOTORS,2,19,1,"Although Tata Motors' website does not explicitly mention a 'Sexual Harassment Policy', it does state that harassment in any form is not tolerated and encourages every employee to discourage such misdemeanours in the workplace. Additionally, the company has publicly disclosed its policy on prevention, prohibition, and redressal of sexual harassment at workplace (Page 141 of the Annual Report as of 31st March 2024), which demonstrates a commitment to addressing sexual harassment. Furthermore, the report mentions that during FY24, 11 complaints of sexual harassment were received, with 7 suitably closed according to company processes. This provides some information on the number of incidents, although more details would be ideal for a higher score."
2025-02-26 21:09:37,TATAMOTORS,2,20,1,"Tata Motors has policies and practices related to supplier/vendor selection, as evident from the Code of Conduct 2015 (specifically section G). However, while there are guidelines for vendor interactions through the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy (page 8), a formal, comprehensive supplier/vendor management policy with detailed control mechanisms and standards is not explicitly provided in this document set. This suggests that policies are available either for supplier/contractor selection (Code of Conduct) or management (Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy), but not both."

2025-02-26 21:10:24,TATAMOTORS,2,23,2,"Tata Motors spent ₹21.59 crore on CSR activities during the financial year ending March 31, 2024, which represents 0.07% of the consolidated profit after tax. This meets the criteria of spending more than or equal to 0.02 times of their profit in CSR activities."
2025-02-26 21:10:32,TATAMOTORS,3,28,2,"The auditor's report expresses an unmodified (clean) opinion on the consolidated financial statements, indicating that there are no significant concerns or qualifications raised by the auditors. There is no mention of a qualified opinion or emphasis of matter. Additionally, the auditors were re-appointed for a five-year term, which suggests a high level of confidence in their independence and objectivity."
2025-02-26 21:10:41,TATAMOTORS,3,32,2,"The Tata Motors Limited has a comprehensive policy for related party transactions, which covers all the required aspects: definition of ordinary course of business, materiality thresholds, and requirement for external auditor review. The policy defines 'Ordinary Course of Business' in Section 3.2, outlines materiality thresholds in Section 4, and mentions the need for review and documentation of related party transactions by the company and its subsidiaries in Section 5.3.1.9 (although it doesn't explicitly mention external auditors)."
2025-02-26 21:10:49,TATAMOTORS,3,36,2,"The shareholding pattern is presented on page 251, providing a breakdown by category and percentage of holding for each category. Additionally, the top 10 shareholders are listed on page 252, with their shareholding as of March 31, 2024. The report clearly consolidates figures based on the Permanent Account Number ('PAN') of the shareholder. Both the shareholding pattern and top 10 shareholder names are transparently disclosed in the annual report."
2025-02-26 21:10:53,TATAMOTORS,3,37,0,"The provided document does not provide shareholding information (number of shares and percentage of total shares) for any board members or key management personnel as per page 235 of Tata Motors Limited's 79th Integrated Annual Report for FY24 (year ended March 31, 2024). No information is available to fulfill the request."
2025-02-26 21:11:03,TATAMOTORS,3,38,1,"Although the company has a dividend distribution policy, it does not specify a target payout ratio. However, the policy aims for a dividend payout ratio in the range of 25% to 40% of the company's annual standalone profits after tax (PAT). The actual payout may vary depending on various factors such as the company's financial performance, investment needs, and other circumstances as determined by the Board of Directors. Although there have been deviations from this target range, the policy does not specify a dividend payout ratio. Therefore, I score it 1."
2025-02-26 21:11:10,TATAMOTORS,3,44,1,"Qualifications, field of expertise, and number of years of experience in the field are available for Key Management Personnel (Mr. Girish Wagh) but not for Board Members or other Key Management Personnel."
2025-02-26 21:11:15,TATAMOTORS,3,45,2,"Based on my analysis of the Tata Motors Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24, there is no mention of any directors, board members, or key managerial personnel being fined by regulatory bodies or stock exchanges. I have reviewed the entire document, including the Board's Report (pages 132-147), the Corporate Governance Report (pages 232-261), and the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (pages 165-208). There is no information indicating any such fines."
2025-02-26 21:11:25,TATAMOTORS,4,48,2,"The average attendance ratio for all board members on an average is more than 0.90. The average attendance ratios calculated from the reports are: 76.3% (2023-24), 94.44% (2022-23) and 95.6% (2021-22). These ratios exceed the threshold of 0.9, indicating that overall attendance for all board members is more than 90%. Therefore, I score this as 2."
2025-02-26 21:11:28,TATAMOTORS,4,49,2,"The Board of Directors held 7 meetings during the fiscal year 2024, which exceeds the threshold of 4 meetings.

2025-02-26 21:11:37,TATAMOTORS,4,51,2,"The Tata Motors Board collectively has strong expertise (more than 10 years in each) in at least 3 areas: General Management and Financial. Additionally, at least one member (Mr. Girish Wagh) has prior working experience in the major industry (automotive) in which company operates. As per page 18 of Tata Motors 79th Integrated Annual Report (2023-24), Mr. Girish Wagh had a 32-year career with Tata Motors, including various roles and the successful development of innovative products across passenger and commercial vehicle segments."
2025-02-26 21:11:42,TATAMOTORS,4,52,2,"The gender ratio calculation shows that out of six independent directors, three are women and three are men, resulting in a gender ratio of 0.5 or 50%. Since the gender ratio is more than 0.3, as per the scoring criteria, I assign a score of 2. The justification for this score is based on page 14 of the 79th Integrated Annual Report of Tata Motors Limited (Source: [Tata Motors Limited's 79th Integrated Annual Report], Page 14)."
2025-02-26 21:11:49,TATAMOTORS,4,53,1,"According to the Tata Motors 79th Integrated Annual Report (as of March 31, 2024), it is stated that 11.1% of the total workforce is female. This information is found on page 96 of the report. Since the female-to-total-workforce ratio is between 0.1 (inclusive) and 0.3, we score this as a 1."
2025-02-26 21:11:56,TATAMOTORS,4,54,1,"Tata Motors Limited has a non-executive chairperson, Mr. N. Chandrasekaran, which meets the criteria for independence. Additionally, as of March 31st, 2024, 75% of the Tata Motors Limited Board of Directors were Independent Directors, also meeting the criteria for independence. Although there is no explicit information regarding vintage members affirming their independence regularly, companies typically disclose such information in their annual reports. The absence of this specific information does not detract from the overall assessment of independence."

However, it is unclear whether all NRC committee members are independent, violating Criterion 2. Additionally, there is no information provided about the tenure of NRC committee members. Only one criterion is violated, so the score is 1."

This satisfies the criteria for scoring 2. Reference: Tata Motors Limited 79th Integrated Annual Report (FY24), page 141 and 132."
