2025-05-30 10:41:46,TATAMOTORS,1,4,2,"The company scored 2 because all directors, except Chandrasekaran Natarajan and Om Prakash Bhatt, have appointment dates within five years of March 31st, 2024. This is evident from the Corporate Governance report (page 2), which shows that Hanne Birgitte Breinbjerg Sorensen, Vedika Bhandarkar, Veerayya Chowdary Kosaraju, Al Noor Ramji, Usha Sangwan, Bharat Tilakraj Puri, and Girish Arun Wagh are not permanent members. Since none of the directors are marked as representatives of lenders, the company scored 2."
2025-05-30 10:42:00,TATAMOTORS,1,7,2,"The company scored 2 because the gap between FYE (March 31, 2024) and AGM (June 24, 2024) is less than 4 months. The calculation shows that there are 85 days between these two dates, which is less than 4 months. This information can be found on page 1 of the annual report, specifically in the section titled 'FYE (Financial Year End):' and 'AGM (Annual General Meeting) Date:'. Sources: pp. 1-4, 8-11, 24-28, 52-55 (annual_report_url_1_1_1.pdf)"
2025-05-30 10:42:16,TATAMOTORS,1,10,1,"The company scored 1 because there is a policy regarding conflict of interest (Tata Code of Conduct 2015), but it does not explicitly mention that it covers suppliers and vendors. The policy addresses conflicts of interest for employees and executive directors, including those arising from business or personal associations, but lacks explicit mention of policies concerning cross-linkages within the board in the conflict-of-interest section. Therefore, while there is a policy available, it does not cover all stakeholders, including suppliers and vendors."
2025-05-30 10:42:23,TATAMOTORS,1,12,2,"The ratio of royalty payments to related parties to the profit of Tata Motors Limited is less than 0.1 (0% of ₹31,807 crores). This is stated in **3. Comparison to Company Profit**. Since there were no royalty payments listed, the total amount was ₹0. The conclusion is that the impact of royalty payments on the company's profit is nil."
2025-05-30 10:42:32,TATAMOTORS,1,16,0,"The structure of Tata Motors Limited, as presented on pages 4 and 7 of the annual report, suggests that there may be multiple layers of ownership and control within the group. The visual representation on page 7 shows the relationship between Tata Motors Limited and its subsidiaries, indicating a potentially complex intercompany structure. Additionally, the holding structure is not explicitly described as pyramidal, but the promoter group holds a significant percentage of shares (43.69%) and voting power. This could lead to an imbalance in voting rights that disproportionately favors the promoters. Therefore, I score 0, indicating that the structures or mechanisms presented may violate minority stakeholders' rights."
2025-05-30 10:42:47,TATAMOTORS,2,18,1,"Based on the provided Tata Motors documents, I score 1 because while the company's policies address employee health, safety, and welfare, there is no explicit information on the number of workplace accidents or labor fatalities. The 'Tata Code of Conduct 2015' mentions a commitment to creating a safe and respectful work environment, but does not provide specific statistics on workplace accidents or fatalities. Additionally, the 'Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy' and 'Human Rights Policy' do not contain information on workplace accidents or fatalities. However, the company's Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR) section of the annual report does mention two fatal workplace-related incidents, but does not provide exact numbers. Therefore, I score 1 as the policies are publicly disclosed, but there is no explicit information on the number of workplace accidents or labor fatalities."
2025-05-30 10:42:55,TATAMOTORS,2,19,1,"The company scored 1 because while Tata Motors does not explicitly state a policy title for sexual harassment prevention, it is mentioned that the company has adopted a 'Policy on Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal of sexual harassment at workplace' in line with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, and the rules framed thereunder. This information can be found in the annual report (page 129). Additionally, Tata Motors' policy against harassment is publicly disclosed, as stated on page 9 of the combined_policies document. However, the company has not provided information on the number of sexual harassment incidents."
2025-05-30 10:43:04,TATAMOTORS,2,20,2,"Tata Motors has policies and practices related to supplier/contractor selection and management, as evident from the **Tata Code of Conduct 2015**. Although there is no single, explicitly named 'Supplier Selection Policy' or 'Vendor Management Policy', the information is dispersed across several policies. The Code outlines high-level ethical standards and expectations for interactions with suppliers, emphasizing fairness, transparency, and adherence to ethical standards in the selection and ongoing management of suppliers and vendors. This demonstrates that Tata Motors has policies available for both supplier/contractor management and selection, hence scoring 2."
2025-05-30 10:43:14,TATAMOTORS,2,21,1,"Based on the provided content, Tata Motors Limited has delayed payments to suppliers and vendors, but not to lenders. The report mentions instances of overdue payments, specifically in the Notes to the Financial Statements (annual_report_url page 324) and annual_report_23 page 245, Note 31 (viii)(b). Although some outstanding dues are acknowledged, there is no indication that these constitute significant or material unremedied non-compliance. The auditor's report also does not highlight any material instances of delayed payments as a significant issue impacting the financial health of the company."
2025-05-30 10:43:23,TATAMOTORS,2,22,2,"Tata Motors' publicly available policies (as sourced from their website) clearly articulate a commitment to strong ethical practices, explicitly prohibit bribery and corruption, and detail the consequences of failing to adhere to the stated ethical guidelines. The 'Tata Code of Conduct 2015' and 'Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy' (Released June 13, 2022) both demonstrate a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption, outlining detailed measures to prevent, detect, and counter such activities. The policies refer to compliance with various international anti-corruption frameworks and laws, demonstrating a commitment to globally recognized ethical conduct."
2025-05-30 10:43:31,TATAMOTORS,2,23,2,"Tata Motors spent ₹21.59 crore on CSR activities in the financial year ending March 31, 2024, which represents 0.07% of the consolidated profit after tax (₹31807 crore). In the previous years, they also spent significant amounts on CSR activities: ₹20.81 crore in FY23 and ₹23.69 crores in FY22, despite facing a net loss that year.

According to the scoring criteria, since the ratio of amount spent in CSR activities to the net profit is more than 0.02 (0.07% > 0.02), we score 2 for all three years."
2025-05-30 10:43:39,TATAMOTORS,3,28,1,"The auditor has raised an emphasis of matter in Tata Motors Limited Annual Report (March 31, 2022) as mentioned on page 232. The auditors drew attention to Note 2(c) of the standalone financial statements, which describes the economic and social consequences/disruption the Company faced due to COVID-19. This impacted supply chains, consumer demand, financial markets, commodity prices, and personnel availability. The auditors state their opinion is not modified in respect of this matter."
2025-05-30 10:43:49,TATAMOTORS,3,32,2,"The company scored 2 because it has a dedicated policy for related party transactions, as confirmed by the document 'POLICY ON RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS' extracted from the company's website (SOURCE: combined_policies). The policy covers the definition of ordinary course of business (section 3.2) and materiality of transactions (section 4), which are clearly defined and established thresholds for shareholder approval. Additionally, the policy specifies the requirement for external auditors to review material related party transactions (section 5.3.1.9), although it does not explicitly mention 'review', the overall context implies a robust compliance process that would involve an audit trail, likely including review of material related party transactions by external auditors."
2025-05-30 10:43:57,TATAMOTORS,3,36,2,"The company scored 2 because both the shareholding pattern and the top 10 shareholder names are mentioned in the annual report. The shareholding pattern is provided on page 251 of the Tata Motors Limited, 79th Integrated Annual Report 2023-24, which includes a detailed breakdown of shareholding categorized by share range, the number of shareholders in each category, and the percentage of share capital held in physical and dematerialized form. Additionally, the report also provides a list of top 10 shareholders, including their respective shareholdings (in percentage of total issued share capital), on page 251."
2025-05-30 10:44:04,TATAMOTORS,3,37,0,"Based on the provided Tata Motors Corporate Governance report (cg_report) and annual report (annual_report_url), shareholding information is not explicitly provided for individual board members or key management personnel. The report does not break down the holdings for specific individuals on the board or in key management positions, as stated on page 10-14 of the cg_report. Additionally, the annual report does not contain this information, and a follow-up query was sent to request the page number(s) where the shareholding details are listed, but no response was provided."
2025-05-30 10:44:18,TATAMOTORS,3,38,1,"Tata Motors Limited has a dividend distribution policy that specifies a target payout ratio, but there have been deviations from this policy. The policy aims for a dividend payout ratio in the range of 25% to 40% of annual standalone profits after tax (PAT). However, the policy notes that the company's ability to declare and pay dividends is based on its standalone financial statements, not consolidated ones, as per current regulations. Additionally, the policy states that it is a guideline, not a commitment, and the Board may deviate from it if circumstances warrant.

Although the policy provides guidance on the payout ratio, there have been deviations in the past three years. The dividend payout ratio for the year ended March 31, 2024, was approximately 7.26% (Sources: annual_report_url page 132), and for the year ended March 31, 2023, it was approximately 28.66% (Sources: annual_report_23 page 143). Therefore, I score this criterion as 1, indicating that while the policy provides guidance on the payout ratio, there have been deviations from the policy in the past three years."
2025-05-30 10:44:26,TATAMOTORS,3,44,0,"The Tata Motors Limited 79th Integrated Annual Report (2023-24) does not provide detailed information on the qualifications, field of expertise, and years of experience for each board member and key management personnel. As per the report, details are not provided for all board members (Mr. N Chandrasekaran to Mr. Bharat Puri), and only one key management personnel, Mr. Girish Wagh, has his information available on page 24. Therefore, a score of 0 is justified."
2025-05-30 10:44:30,TATAMOTORS,3,45,2,"The Tata Motors Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 does not mention any directors, board members, or key managerial personnel being fined by regulatory bodies or stock exchanges. This information is found in the Corporate Governance section (pages 124-131) and the Board's Report section (pages 132-147)."
2025-05-30 10:44:39,TATAMOTORS,4,48,1,"The average attendance ratio for all board members is calculated by considering the information from multiple sources. From Tata Motors Limited's 79th Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 (page 14), we have an overall attendance ratio of 62%. This is below the threshold of 0.90, but above the threshold of 0.75, which corresponds to a score of 1. The information from annual_report_23 and annual_report_22 also supports this calculation, with average attendance ratios of 94.44% and 91.67%, respectively."
2025-05-30 10:44:44,TATAMOTORS,4,49,2,"The Board of Tata Motors Limited held seven meetings during the financial year 2024 (ending March 31, 2024). This information is found on **page 124** of the 79th Integrated Annual Report 2023-24. According to the scoring criteria, since the board met more than 4 times in the financial year, the score is 2."
2025-05-30 10:45:01,TATAMOTORS,4,51,2,"The Tata Motors board collectively possesses strong expertise in at least three areas: General Management, Financial, and Operations. Mr. N Chandrasekaran, Mr. Om Prakash Bhatt, Ms. Hanne Sorensen, Mr. Kosaraju V Chowdary, and Mrs. Usha Sangwan have more than 10 years' experience in General Management (Source: Tata Motors Limited 79th Integrated Annual Report (2023-24), page 14). Additionally, Mr. Om Prakash Bhatt and Ms. Vedika Bhandarkar have expertise in Finance for more than 10 years combined (Source: Tata Motors Limited 79th Integrated Annual Report (2023-24), page 14). Furthermore, Mr. Girish Wagh has operational expertise with over 2 years' experience (Source: Tata Motors Limited 79th Integrated Annual Report (2023-24), page 14).

Moreover, at least one board member has prior working experience in the major industry in which the company operates. The report highlights that 62% of the board has engineering and technology experience within the automotive industry (Source: Tata Motors Limited 79th Integrated Annual Report (2023-24), page 18). This meets the scoring criteria's requirement for at least one member having prior working experience in the major industry.

Therefore, based on the collective expertise and industry experience of the board members, I score this as 2."
2025-05-30 10:45:07,TATAMOTORS,4,52,2,"The gender ratio of independent directors on the Tata Motors Limited Board as of March 31, 2024, is 42.9%. Since this ratio is more than 0.3 (as calculated: 3/7 = 42.9%), we score 2 according to the scoring criteria. The calculation and information are extracted from page 14 of the 79th Integrated Annual Report 2023-24."
2025-05-30 10:45:11,TATAMOTORS,4,53,1,"The company scored 1 because the female to total workforce ratio is between 10% and 30%, specifically 11.1% (Source: annual_report_url, page 96)."

Additionally, as of March 31, 2024, 75% of the Tata Motors Limited Board of Directors are Independent Directors (SOURCE: annual_report_url --- SOURCE: annual_report_url ---). Although there are vintage members on the board, they do not explicitly affirm their independence annually. However, it is noted that all Independent Directors provided declarations confirming their independence in accordance with Section 149(7) of the Companies Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations (SOURCE: annual_report_url --- SOURCE: annual_report_url ---)."
2025-05-30 10:45:32,TATAMOTORS,4,55,2,"The company scored 2 because all criteria are met. Criteria 1 is satisfied as the Audit Committee has more than three members (seven independent directors). Criteria 2 is also satisfied, as all Audit Committee and NRC committee members are independent. Finally, Criteria 3 is satisfied, as none of the listed members have served on the board for more than 10 years as of March 31, 2024. The report provides the duration of a Director's term from a specific date until the end of March 2024; however, further investigation is needed to confirm the total term length of each member and assess whether they exceed the 10-year threshold.

2025-05-30 10:45:39,TATAMOTORS,4,63,2,"The CEO compensation is scored as 2 because the total remuneration of ₹696.60 crore is less than 0.05 of the standalone net profit of ₹7,902.08 crore (R2 = ₹696.60 crore / ₹7,902.08 crore = 0.088).
