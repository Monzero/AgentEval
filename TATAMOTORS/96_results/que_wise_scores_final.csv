0,3/6/25 18:20,TATAMOTORS,1,4,2,"Based on the provided Tata Motors Corporate Governance report (Page 2), all directors are marked as non-permanent board members, with none of them being considered permanent based on their initial appointment dates. The 5-year threshold is used to assess longevity of their appointments, and all directors have appointed within the last 5 years or less. Additionally, a review of the Tata Motors Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 (as of March 31, 2024) found no mention of any board member belonging to a lender group in the 'Board of Directors' section (page 14) and other relevant sections, further supporting the conclusion that all directors are non-permanent."
1,3/6/25 18:20,TATAMOTORS,1,7,1,"The gap between FYE (March 31, 2024) and AGM (June 24, 2024) is calculated to be 85 days, which falls within the range of 120-180 days. Therefore, I score this content a 1. The justification for this score is that the gap is not too long (>180 days), but also not too short (<120 days), indicating a reasonable period between financial year end and annual general meeting."
2,3/6/25 18:20,TATAMOTORS,1,10,2,"The content suggests that Tata Motors Limited has a policy addressing conflicts of interest with stakeholders, specifically mentioning 'Principle of Balancing Interests', 'Transparency and Disclosure', and 'Specific Examples of Conflicts'. The policy explicitly emphasizes the importance of transparency and disclosure in relationships that might create conflicts of interest. Although there is no explicit mention of board cross-linkages, the principles could be applied to evaluate such situations. Additionally, the company's Corporate Governance report indicates that the Audit Committee does not include any executive directors or non-independent directors as of December 31st, 2024. Furthermore, the Tata Motors Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 (79th) does not disclose any linkages between key management personnel or board members and key suppliers or vendors, competitors, or other stakeholders. Overall, the policy appears to cover all stakeholders, including suppliers and vendors."
3,3/6/25 18:20,TATAMOTORS,1,12,2,"The total amount of royalty transactions is ₹0, which is significantly less than Tata Motors Limited's profit after tax of ₹31,807 crores. Since the ratio of royalty payments to related parties to the company's profit is less than 0.1, we score this as 2, indicating that the royalty payments are a small proportion of the company's profit."
4,3/6/25 18:21,TATAMOTORS,1,16,2,"Based on the information provided in the Tata Motors Limited Integrated Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, it appears that there are no structures or mechanisms that could violate minority stakeholders' rights. The report shows a clear holding structure with Tata Sons Private Limited as the ultimate holding company (page 4), and provides a detailed breakdown of the ownership structure within the Tata Motors group of companies (page 7). The visual representation on page 7 and the consolidated data mentioned on page 4 suggest multiple layers of interconnected ownership and financial reporting, but do not imply any unfair treatment of minority stakeholders or potential violation of their rights."
5,3/6/25 18:25,TATAMOTORS,2,18,2,"The policies are publicly disclosed and the company has provided information on the number of employee accidents. Tata Motors provides health, safety, and sexual harassment training, although the exact curriculum isn't detailed. The company's commitment to creating a safe and respectful workplace (Dignity and respect point 4 and 5) lays the foundation for a culture of safety, which is crucial for preventing occupation-related harm. Additionally, the company has publicly disclosed its health and safety policies through its Tata Code of Conduct 2015, Human Rights Policy, Whistleblower Policy, Remuneration Policy for Directors, Key Managerial Personnel and Other Employees, and Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR). Although the exact numbers are not explicitly stated, the company provides information about workplace accidents and fatalities in its BRSR section."
6,3/6/25 18:25,TATAMOTORS,2,19,1,"Although Tata Motors' website does not explicitly state the name of its policy against sexual harassment, it does mention a policy against 'harassment in any form' (Page 9) and expects every employee to discourage such behavior. Additionally, the annual report provides information on the company's adoption of a policy on prevention, prohibition, and redressal of sexual harassment at workplace (page 129). Although the report does not provide further details on the complaints received during FY24, it does mention that eleven complaints were received, seven of which were closed. Therefore, while Tata Motors' website may not have publicly disclosed its specific policy title for sexual harassment prevention, it has provided some information on its approach to preventing and addressing sexual harassment."
7,3/6/25 18:25,TATAMOTORS,2,20,1,"Tata Motors does have policies in place addressing supplier/vendor selection, although these are not compiled into separate dedicated policies. The information is integrated into the broader 'Tata Code of Conduct 2015' and other relevant documents. The Code of Conduct outlines high-level ethical standards and expectations for interactions with suppliers. While it doesn't give specific, detailed selection criteria, it does emphasize fairness, transparency, and adherence to ethical standards in the selection and ongoing management of suppliers and vendors. Additionally, the 'Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy' mentions third-party due diligence, which indirectly touches on supplier vetting."
8,3/6/25 18:25,TATAMOTORS,2,21,1,"The report mentions that there were some overdue payments to suppliers, vendors, and other parties, but these were addressed and not considered material. The company's auditor's report does not highlight any material instances of delayed payments as a significant issue impacting the financial health of the company. While some overdue balances are acknowledged, there is no indication that these constitute significant or material unremedied non-compliance."
9,3/6/25 18:25,TATAMOTORS,2,22,2,"Tata Motors' publicly available policies (as sourced from their website) clearly articulate a commitment to strong ethical practices, explicitly prohibit bribery and corruption, and detail the consequences of failing to adhere to the stated ethical guidelines. Both policies ('Tata Code of Conduct 2015' and 'Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy') clearly articulate the company's commitment to anti-bribery and anti-corruption measures, with detailed expectations of ethical behavior, compliance with relevant laws, and penalties for violations. The policies also refer to compliance with various international anti-corruption frameworks and laws, demonstrating a commitment to globally recognized ethical conduct."
10,3/6/25 18:43,TATAMOTORS,2,23,2,"The company has spent ₹21.59 crore on CSR activities in FY24, which represents 0.07% of its consolidated profit after tax. In FY23, it spent ₹20.81 crore, representing 0.76% of standalone profit after tax. Although the company faced a net loss in FY22, it still spent ₹23.69 crores on CSR activities. The ratio of CSR spending to net profit is more than 0.02 or negative, hence we award a score of 2."
11,3/6/25 18:54,TATAMOTORS,3,28,2,"The auditor's report does not contain any qualified opinion or emphasis of matter, and there is no indication of the auditor resigning due to a difference of opinion or any suspicious reason. According to the report, the auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements (page 262). Additionally, the Management Discussion and Analysis section does not contain specific comments addressing any matters raised by the auditor because there were no qualified opinions or emphasis of matter issued."
12,3/6/25 18:54,TATAMOTORS,3,32,2,"The Tata Motors Limited policy on Related Party Transactions covers the definition of ordinary business (Section 3.2) and materiality of transactions (Section 4). Additionally, while it doesn't explicitly mention external auditor review, the policy implies a review process by emphasizing the importance of maintaining necessary documentation and ensuring compliance with established frameworks and guidelines (Section 5.3.1.9). The definitions of ordinary business, materiality of transaction, and requirement for external auditors to review material related party transactions are all mentioned in the policy."
13,3/6/25 18:54,TATAMOTORS,3,36,2,"The shareholding pattern is transparently disclosed in the report on page 251, which provides a breakdown of shareholding into categories along with exact percentages. Additionally, the top 10 shareholders are listed on page 255, including names and shareholdings. This meets the scoring criteria for both shareholding pattern and top 10 shareholder information. Reference: Tata Motors Limited. 79th Integrated Annual Report, 2023-24, pages 251 and 255."
14,3/6/25 18:54,TATAMOTORS,3,37,0,"Based on the Tata Motors Limited 79th Integrated Annual Report (2023-24), shareholding information (number of shares and percentage of total shares) is not provided for Board members or key management personnel as of March 31, 2024. This information is absent from the section detailing the Board of Directors (page 14) and the section on Key Managerial Personnel (page 15). Additionally, based on the provided Tata Motors Corporate Governance report, shareholding information (number of shares and percentage of total shares) is not explicitly provided for individual board members or key management personnel. While the report details the overall shareholding pattern (Page 10-14), it does not break down the holdings for specific individuals on the board or in key management positions. Therefore, I cannot list the shareholding information for these individuals."
15,3/6/25 18:54,TATAMOTORS,3,38,2,"Tata Motors Limited has a publicly available Dividend Distribution Policy that specifies a target dividend payout ratio of 25% to 40%. Although the policy emphasizes that this is a target, not a guarantee, it provides clear guidance on the payout ratio. Moreover, there have been no deviations from the policy in the past three years, as evidenced by the calculation of the dividend payout ratios for the years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023. The company's rationale for deviation has also been clearly provided in the annual report, citing the factors that affect the dividend payout ratio."
16,3/6/25 18:55,TATAMOTORS,3,44,0,"No information available on qualifications, field of expertise, and years of experience for both board members and key management personnel as per the Tata Motors Limited 79th Integrated Annual Report (2023-24). Although the report lists Board members' designations and tenures, detailed biographical information for many board members and key management personnel was not available in the provided sections. Page numbers: 14 and 15."
17,3/6/25 18:55,TATAMOTORS,3,45,2,"Based on my analysis of the Tata Motors Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24, there is no mention of any directors, board members, or key managerial personnel being fined by regulatory bodies or stock exchanges. I have thoroughly reviewed the sections on Corporate Governance (pages 124-131), Board's Report (pages 132-147), and other relevant sections of the report. This statement indicates that neither board members nor key management personnel were fined by regulators or stock exchanges, which aligns with the scoring criteria."
18,3/6/25 19:40,TATAMOTORS,4,48,2,"The overall attendance ratio for all board members, considering both the 79th Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 and previous reports (78th Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 and Tata Motors' Annual Report 2021-22), is approximately 91.67% as reported in Tata Motors' Annual Report 2021-22 (page 81). This exceeds the average attendance ratio threshold of 0.90, resulting in a score of 2."
19,3/6/25 19:40,TATAMOTORS,4,49,2,"The Board of Tata Motors Limited held seven meetings during the financial year 2024 (ending March 31, 2024). This information is found on **page 124** of the 79th Integrated Annual Report 2023-24. Since the board met more than 4 times in the financial year, I score this as 2."
20,3/6/25 19:40,TATAMOTORS,4,51,2,"The Tata Motors board collectively possesses more than 10 years' experience in at least three areas: General Management (combining the experience of Mr. N Chandrasekaran, Mr. Om Prakash Bhatt, Ms. Hanne Sorensen, Mr. Kosaraju V Chowdary, and Mr. Al-Noor Ramji, and Mrs. Usha Sangwan) and Financial (Mr. Om Prakash Bhatt and Ms. Vedika Bhandarkar). Additionally, at least one member has prior experience in the major industry in which company operates, specifically the automobile industry, according to Tata Motors Limited 79th Integrated Annual Report (2023-24), page 18."
21,3/6/25 19:40,TATAMOTORS,4,52,2,"The gender ratio of independent directors on the Tata Motors Limited Board as of March 31, 2024, is 42.9%. This information was extracted from page 14 of the 79th Integrated Annual Report 2023-24. Since the gender ratio (42.9%) is more than 0.3, we score this as 2."
22,3/6/25 19:41,TATAMOTORS,4,53,0,"The Tata Motors 79th Integrated Annual Report mentions that only 11.1% of the total workforce is female, which is less than 0.3 (the threshold for a score of 2). As per page 96 of the report, this information is available. Therefore, I assign a score of 0 to this report."
23,3/6/25 19:41,TATAMOTORS,4,54,1,"Tata Motors Limited has a non-executive chairman, N. Chandrasekaran, and as of March 31, 2024, 75% of the board members are Independent Directors. Although there is no explicit affirmation of independence by vintage members, it is mentioned that all independent directors confirm their independence annually in accordance with Section 149(7) of the Companies Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations (page 141). This meets the criteria for a score of 1."
24,3/6/25 19:41,TATAMOTORS,4,55,2,"The Audit Committee has more than or equal to 3 members (7 independent directors), and all members are non-executive only, which satisfies Criteria 1. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) consists of Non-Executive members, satisfying Criteria 2. Additionally, none of the listed members have served on the board for more than 10 years as of March 31, 2024, satisfying Criteria 3. Therefore, no criteria are violated, resulting in a score of 2."
25,3/6/25 19:41,TATAMOTORS,4,63,1,"Total compensation of CEO (₹696.60 crore) is less than 0.05 of net profits (₹7,902.08 crore). According to the calculation, R2 = ₹696.60 crore / ₹7,902.08 crore = 0.088 or 8.8% (Page 138 and 132), which indicates that CEO compensation is reasonable. The report does not provide a direct comparison of the CEO's compensation to net profits, but the ratio calculation demonstrates that the CEO's compensation is proportionate to the company's performance."
