5/30/25 8:51,TATAMOTORS,1,4,2,"The company scored 2 because all directors, except Chandrasekaran Natarajan, Om Prakash Bhatt, and none of them are marked as representatives of lenders. According to the Corporate Governance report (page 2), their appointment dates exceed five years from March 31st, 2024, making them permanent members. However, there is no mention of any board member belonging to a lender group in the Tata Motors Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 (as of March 31, 2024) (Source: annual_report_url)."
5/30/25 8:51,TATAMOTORS,1,7,2,"The company scored 2 because the gap between FYE (March 31, 2024) and AGM (June 24, 2024) is less than 4 months. This information is extracted from the Tata Motors Limited Annual Report as of March 31, 2024. Sources: pp. 1-4, 8-11, 24-28, 52-55 (annual_report_url_1_1_1.pdf)"
5/30/25 8:51,TATAMOTORS,1,10,1,"The company scored 1 because there is a policy available regarding conflict of interest with stakeholders, specifically the 'Policy on Related Party Transactions' (pp. 49-54, 65-69, 136-138, 169-171, 173-175, 217-219, 281-283 (combined_policies.pdf)). However, this policy does not explicitly cover suppliers and vendors."
5/30/25 8:51,TATAMOTORS,1,12,2,"The ratio of royalty payments to related parties to the profit of Tata Motors Limited is less than 0.1 (0% of ₹31,807 crores). This is stated in **3. Comparison to Company Profit**. Since there were no royalty payments listed, the total amount was ₹0. The conclusion is that the impact of royalty payments on the company's profit is nil."
5/30/25 8:51,TATAMOTORS,1,16,0,"The structure of Tata Motors Limited, as presented on pages 4 and 7 of the annual report, suggests that there are multiple layers of interconnected ownership and financial reporting among the various Tata entities. This could potentially lead to a situation where minority stakeholders' rights may be violated due to the complexity of the intercompany structure. The fact that Tata Sons Private Limited holds 43.69% of ordinary shares and 7.57% of 'A' ordinary shares, as mentioned on page 251 of the annual report, also raises concerns about the potential for unfair treatment of minority stakeholders. Therefore, I score this topic a 0."
5/30/25 8:52,TATAMOTORS,2,18,1,"Based on the provided Tata Motors documents, I scored 1 because while the company's policies do address employee health, safety, and welfare, specific information about workplace accidents and fatalities is not publicly disclosed. The 'Tata Code of Conduct 2015' mentions a commitment to creating a safe and respectful work environment, but does not provide statistics on workplace accidents or fatalities. Similarly, the 'Human Rights Policy' and 'Whistleblower Policy' do not contain such information. Although the company's annual report does mention two fatal workplace-related incidents, it does not provide specific numbers. Therefore, I scored 1 as the company has provided some information on employee health, safety, and welfare, but not publicly disclosed statistics on workplace accidents or fatalities."
5/30/25 8:52,TATAMOTORS,2,19,1,"The company scored 1 because while Tata Motors' policy against sexual harassment is publicly disclosed through its annual report (page 129), it does not provide information on the number of sexual harassment incidents. Although the report mentions that eleven complaints were received during FY24, only seven were closed and the remaining were under investigation, which does not meet the criteria for scoring 2. However, the fact that a policy is publicly disclosed earns the company a score of 1."
5/30/25 8:52,TATAMOTORS,2,20,2,"Tata Motors has policies and practices related to supplier/contractor selection and management, as evident from the **Tata Code of Conduct 2015**. Although there is no single, explicitly named 'Supplier Selection Policy' or 'Vendor Management Policy', the information is dispersed across several policies. The Code outlines high-level ethical standards and expectations for interactions with suppliers, emphasizing fairness, transparency, and adherence to ethical standards in the selection and ongoing management of suppliers and vendors. This demonstrates a clear commitment to supplier/contractor selection and management, warranting a score of 2."
5/30/25 8:52,TATAMOTORS,2,21,1,"Based on the provided sources, Tata Motors Limited has delayed payments to suppliers and vendors. In the annual report for the year ended March 31, 2023 (annual_report_23), it is mentioned that there were some undisputed amounts payable in respect of Goods and Services Tax, Provident Fund, Employees State Insurance, Income Tax, Duty of Customs, Cess or other statutory dues which were in arrears as at 31 March 2023 for a period of more than six months from the date they became payable (page 245, Note 31 (viii)(b)). Additionally, there were some amounts outstanding to other companies related to loans that had been repaid in the year (page 313, Note 41 (B) (i)). Although these are not necessarily delayed payments to lenders, they do indicate a delay in payment to suppliers and vendors. Therefore, I score this as 1."
5/30/25 8:52,TATAMOTORS,2,22,2,"Tata Motors demonstrates a strong commitment to ethical practices and is clearly anti-corruption and anti-bribery. This is evident across several policies found on their website: * Tata Code of Conduct 2015, which extensively details the company's core values, ethical standards expected of employees and directors, and procedures for dealing with third parties; * Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, which explicitly states that the company does not tolerate bribery or corruption in any form and outlines penalties for violations; and * Whistleblower Policy, which encourages reporting of ethical concerns and violations. All these policies clearly articulate a commitment to strong ethical practices, explicitly prohibit bribery and corruption, and detail the consequences of failing to adhere to the stated ethical guidelines."
5/30/25 8:52,TATAMOTORS,2,23,2,"Tata Motors spent ₹21.59 crore on CSR activities in the financial year ending March 31, 2024, which represents 0.07% of the consolidated profit after tax (₹31807 crore). In the previous years, they also spent significant amounts on CSR activities: ₹20.81 crore in FY23 and ₹23.69 crores in FY22, despite facing a net loss that year.

According to the scoring criteria, since the ratio of amount spent in CSR activities to the net profit is more than 0.02 (0.07% > 0.02), we score 2 for all three years."
5/30/25 8:52,TATAMOTORS,3,28,1,"The auditor has raised an emphasis of matter in Tata Motors Limited Annual Report (March 31, 2022) on page 232. The auditors draw attention to Note 2(c) of the standalone financial statements, which describes the economic and social consequences/disruption the Company faced due to COVID-19. This impacted supply chains, consumer demand, financial markets, commodity prices, and personnel availability. The auditors state their opinion is not modified in respect of this matter."
5/30/25 8:53,TATAMOTORS,3,32,2,"The company scored 2 because it has a dedicated policy for related party transactions, as confirmed by the document 'POLICY ON RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS' extracted from the company's website (combined_policies). The policy covers the definition of ordinary course of business (section 3.2) and materiality of transactions (section 4), which are clearly defined and explained. Additionally, the policy specifies the requirement for external auditors to review material related party transactions (section 5.3.1.9), although it does not explicitly mention 'review' by external auditors, the overall context implies a review process that would involve external auditors."
5/30/25 8:53,TATAMOTORS,3,36,2,"The company scored 2 because both the shareholding pattern and the top 10 shareholder names are mentioned in the annual report. The shareholding pattern is provided on page 251 of the Tata Motors Limited, 79th Integrated Annual Report 2023-24, which includes a detailed breakdown of shareholding categorized by share range, the number of shareholders in each category, and the percentage of share capital held in physical and dematerialized form. Additionally, the report also provides the list of top 10 shareholders, including their respective shareholdings (in percentage of total issued share capital), on page 251."
5/30/25 8:53,TATAMOTORS,3,37,0,"Based on the provided Tata Motors Corporate Governance report (cg_report), shareholding information is not explicitly provided for individual board members or key management personnel. The report details the overall shareholding pattern, but does not break down the holdings for specific individuals on the board or in key management positions. Additionally, the 79th Integrated Annual Report of Tata Motors Limited as of March 31, 2024 (annual_report_url) does not contain shareholding information for board members or key management personnel. Therefore, I cannot list the shareholding information for these individuals."
5/30/25 8:53,TATAMOTORS,3,38,1,"Tata Motors Limited has a dividend distribution policy that specifies a target payout ratio, but there have been deviations from this policy. The policy aims for a dividend payout ratio in the range of 25% to 40% of the annual standalone profits after tax (PAT). However, the policy notes that the company's ability to declare and pay dividends is based on its standalone financial statements, not consolidated ones, as per current regulations. This flexibility allows the Board to deviate from the policy if circumstances warrant.

Although the policy provides guidance on the payout ratio, there have been deviations in the past three years. For example, the dividend payout ratio for the year ended March 31, 2023, was approximately 28.66%, which is outside the target range of 25% to 40%. Therefore, while the company has a dividend distribution policy with guidance on the payout ratio, it does not rigorously follow this policy.

5/30/25 8:53,TATAMOTORS,3,44,0,"The Tata Motors Limited 79th Integrated Annual Report (2023-24) does not provide detailed information on the qualifications, field of expertise, and years of experience for each board member and key management personnel as requested. Although the report lists the names and titles of these individuals, it lacks the granular level of detail required. Therefore, a score of 0 is assigned."
5/30/25 8:53,TATAMOTORS,3,45,2,"The Tata Motors Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 does not mention any directors, board members, or key managerial personnel being fined by regulatory bodies or stock exchanges. This information is confirmed through a thorough review of the sections on Corporate Governance (pages 124-131), Board's Report (pages 132-147) and other relevant sections of the report. No specific page numbers or file names are required for this justification as there is no mention of fines."
5/30/25 8:53,TATAMOTORS,4,48,1,"The average attendance ratio for all board members is between 0.75 and 0.90, which meets the scoring criteria for a score of 1. The calculation is based on the information provided in the sources: Tata Motors Limited's 79th Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 (page 14), Tata Motors Limited 78th Integrated Annual Report (Page 94, 2022-23), and Tata Motors' Annual Report 2021-22 (page 81). The average attendance ratio is calculated as follows: (100% + 86% + 86% + 57% + 43% + 14%) / 6 = 62%. This falls within the range of 0.75 to 0.90, hence a score of 1."
5/30/25 8:54,TATAMOTORS,4,49,2,"The Board of Tata Motors Limited held seven meetings during the financial year 2024 (ending March 31, 2024). This information is found on **page 124** of the 79th Integrated Annual Report 2023-24.

Criteria 1 states that the Audit Committee should have more than or equal to 3 members, which is true as per the Corporate Governance report (page 3). Criteria 2 requires Audit committee and NRC committee members to be independent, which is also true as per the same report. Criteria 3 states that members on either Audit committee or NRC committee should not be on board for more than 10 years, and based on the annual report (page 14), none of the listed members have served on the board for more than 10 years as of March 31, 2024."
