Corporate Overview
Letter to Shareholders
Dear Shareholders,
India is at the cusp of the next stage of the smartphone-led revolution. Starting from internet 
connectivity led by smartphones, and that becoming the foundation of the digitally enabled life 
that is now reality. 
Paytm pioneered mobile payments in India and led mass adoption with innovations like QR Codes 
and Soundbox. 
In India, we can expect 500 million payment consumers and 100 million merchants not very far in 
future. This is made possible by Paytm leading from the front, our government’s agenda to drive 
Digital India and the regulator's encouragement to build an open scalable payment system. We are 
not only beneficiaries but also the biggest champions of government and regulator driven Digital 
Public Infrastructure. 
In my opinion, the success of current digital public infrastructure is giving way to new services 
clearly in financial services, and also in new areas like health and retail. 
Paytm’s philosophy is that payment is the truest acknowledgement of trust and transaction assurance 
between two parties. We have kept that as our core offering and built many technologies to enable 
confidence and trust, for e.g., for the small merchants to receive and make mobile payments. 
We are expanding on our success with Paytm Soundbox and have invested heavily in IoT devices. 
We launched Pocket and Music Soundbox enabled by 4G technology. I am particularly proud that 
these are completely designed and made in India. 
I believe India has an opportunity to become a net exporter of payment technology, software and 
hardware, and I expect Paytm to lead the way in this. Our R&D design and software capabilities are 
the best in the world, in which Paytm Labs is constantly building various AI and big data features 
that enhance payment trust, when consumers or merchants use Paytm. 
The true dividend of the payment economy in India will be distribution of small credit at low cost 
leveraging payment relationships with customers. RBI’s Digital Loan Service Provider system aptly 
captures it. Since June 2020, when RBI first came with digital loan disbursement guidelines, we 
have built our business on core principles guided in the circular and refined later on. 
It is my belief that the true economic GDP growth benefit of reaching the last person in the financial 
system will be our success. We have set our mission to enable 500 million Indians to get benefits 
of mainstream economic growth. This begins by enabling them with mobile payments and helping 
extend various other financial services like loan, insurance etc. to them.

Annual Report 
2023
Corporate Overview
We have created a successful template in the last 2 years of distributing small digital loans using 
payment relationships with consumers and merchants. Our lending partners own the risk and 
leverage our ability to help them distribute and collect loans. In products where it is viable for them, 
they can of course collect the loans themselves. 
By helping enable digital loan collection on app, we are now creating a small revolution for financial 
inclusion, where a loan of as small as a few hundred rupees can be disbursed and collected at very 
miniscule cost. In India’s Digital revolution after mobile payments, Paytm’s next contribution will be – 
small mobile credit with high credit quality and fully compliant with the regulators guidelines. 
Expectedly this requires sophisticated capabilities in AI and other technologies. I am very proud of 
our Advanced AI capabilities in use and how we are expanding. We are building an India scale AI 
system which will help various financial institutes in capturing possible risks and frauds, while also 
protecting them from new kinds of risks due to advancement in AI. 
Paytm is investing in AI with an eye on building Artificial General Intelligence software stack. We 
believe by building it in India we are not only making our country’s tech capability, also creating 
something that could be leveraged outside India. 
With a disciplined and result oriented approach in all our selected investment areas, we are sure we 
will be able to capitalize and build strong differentiators in the market and in turn a business that 
scales efficiently without linearly adding to costs. 
Having PayPay Japan as a partner and customer adds to our advantage as the system costs are 
shared between two countries. 
Beyond payment and credit disbursement business, I am very excited by possibilities of ONDC – Open 
Network of Digital Commerce, an initiative of Government India. We have seen very encouraging 
early results of the same. 
In my opinion, in the next 3 years you will see some worthy numbers and results of hard work 
put in by the team. Your company’s team remains committed to serve India and build a long term 
profitable business. 
Best,
Vijay Shekhar Sharma

Macroeconomic overview
Mobile payments in India have grown tremendously in the past few years. We believe that there is 
ample scope to further deepen penetration as customers and businesses are adopting affordable 
and easy-to-use technology.  
We believe these consumers and businesses can be served through world-class, technology-led, 
mobile payment and financial services.
India continues to be one of the fastest growing economies globally, and is expected to grow at 
a CAGR of 7-9% over next five years, according to RedSeer and broker estimates. Key drivers of 
economic growth will be (i) rising consumption, (ii) favourable demographics with a large working 
population, and (iii) growing urbanisation.
Industry overview and Outlook 
Multiple developments over the past few years have helped build India’s payments landscape, be 
it innovations in mobile payments infrastructure, continued regulatory support, or government 
initiatives to push for increased consumer and merchant acceptance. 
Given the increasing shift towards a cashless economy and user preference for transacting via 
smartphones, mobile payments continue to scale rapidly. This is further boosted by the growth 
of mobile commerce and services. As a result, unique online transacting users, transacting for 
services such as online banking, mobile top-ups, in-store payments etc. are expected to grow from 
250-300 million in FY 2021 to 700-750 million by FY 2026(1).
Paytm remains central to the growth of payments across the country. We offer a suite of payment 
solutions to both consumers and merchants. Consumers have a wide variety of use cases on the 
Paytm app, such as bill payments, recharge, adding funds to wallet, money transfers, etc. Paytm 
enables both consumers and merchants to use a variety of payment instruments to make and 
accept payments. This enables merchants to use Paytm app traffic and expand their businesses, 
making for attractive cross-sell opportunities especially in our loan distribution business. 
Non-cash payment methods remain under-penetrated in India, when compared to other countries. 
The value of card transactions (credit card + debit card) remains at c.7% of GDP in FY 2023, lower 
than developed countries which have higher penetration at 30%+ of GDP. Including mobile payments 
such as UPI (P2M only), this ratio is c.18%. As per estimates from brokers, most of Paytm’s TAMs 
are expected to grow at 20%+ CAGR over the next five years. Broker research estimates the digital 
payments TAM in India to be USD 650bn in FY 23 (merchant payments only; cards + UPI), having 
grown at 41% CAGR since FY 17. They forecast India’s payments TAM to grow at a 23% FY 22-30E 
CAGR to reach USD 2.3tn by FY30E.

& Analysis
By FY 2026, retail lending is expected to be a US$1 tn market, and MSME lending is expected to 
be a US$600 bn market (Source: RedSeer). Across such traditional financial services products, 
India has growth opportunities aided by technology and rising digitization to increase access 
and reach. Industry research estimates that the total BNPL market in India stood at US$3 bn in 
FY 2021, of which US$2 bn was through online channels, while remaining US$1 bn was through 
offline channels. They forecast the BNPL industry to grow at 65% FY 21-26E CAGR to reach US$35 
bn (c.14% of credit spends) by FY 2026E. Of the US$35bn, they estimate online channels to 
constitute US$24 bn and the remainder US$11 bn from offline medium.
Our Business Model
We offer a comprehensive suite of payments services to consumers and merchants and leverage 
our ecosystem to cross-sell high-margin financial services as well as commerce and cloud services.
Our payments business is an important customer and merchant acquisition tool, and in turn, an 
attractive funnel for other businesses such as credit distribution and enabling commerce businesses. 
The large size of our distribution network coupled with data insights from payment and commerce 
businesses, allows us to distribute high-margin financial services such as small ticket credit to our 
consumers and merchants. For consumers and merchants, we offer various lending products, with 
our financial institution partners, such as Paytm Postpaid (BNPL), Personal Loans and Merchant 
Loans.
Payment Services
On our app, consumers can use a wide selection of instruments, such as Paytm Payment Instruments 
like Wallet, Paytm Postpaid (BNPL) as well as third party instruments like cards, net banking to make 
online payments for a variety of use cases. Consumers can also make online payments on third 
party apps and in-store payments through QR codes and devices.

On the merchant side of our platform, we help our partners grow their businesses by providing 
solutions that allow them to accept payments through a wide variety of instruments and by deploying 
devices that help receive payments and with reconciliation. We earn about ₹100 to ₹500 per month 
per device.
• Entry level merchants can use a free Mobile QR to accept payments, typically using Paytm 
Payment Instruments or UPI.
• Small retailers can upgrade to Soundbox devices which allow better reconciliation for merchants, 
and generate subscription revenues for us. 
• Our mid-sized and large retailers also use our card machines which enables them to accept 
mobile and card payments, thus generating both MDR as well as subscription revenues for us. 
• For Online and Omni channel merchants we offer a robust payment gateway product allowing 
merchants to reliably accept payments across all channels, From these merchants, we earn

The increased adoption of payments use-cases has resulted in our Monthly Transacting Users

Financial Services
Financial Services business consists of loan distribution (in partnership with lending partners), as 
well as insurance and wealth management offerings. 
Loan Distribution
As part of our loan distribution business, we operate a technology platform with capabilities across 
the entire loan lifecycle including origination, loan management and collection to provide seamless 
credit access to our consumers and merchants through our financial institution partners. Lending 
partners are able to work with Paytm to service a segment that previously did not have access to 
this type of financing. In addition to handling distribution, we also collect loans on behalf of lending 
partners, by leveraging our technological and digital capabilities, which ensures that our collection 
business is a low-cost process. 
Our lending business continues to scale providing attractive upsell revenues. Our lending partners 
disbursed over 4 crore loans through our platform in FY 2023, a 163% growth over FY 2022. The 
value of loans grew 364% to ₹35,378 Cr in FY 2023, from ₹7,623 Cr in FY 2022.

Commerce and Cloud Services 
To help our merchant partners grow their business by leveraging Paytm’s consumer traffic, we offer 
them services like ability to sell tickets, deals and gift vouchers to customers. In addition, we also 
provide advertising, and loyalty services. In the Commerce business, we generally earn 5-6% take-
rate on GMV.
The distribution of co-branded credit cards falls under our cloud business. As of March 2023, we 
have a total of 589,000 active cards with SBI Card and HDFC Bank. It is noteworthy that 90% of 
customers who obtain a credit card through Paytm remain active users driven by the variety of use 
cases on the Paytm App. This enables us to generate upfront revenue on card activation and receive 
a portion of the interchange fee for the lifetime of the card. We see a strong runway for growth in 
this business, especially given the upsell potential from payments and lending consumers.
Business Update and Outlook
FY 2023 was a strong year for us. In April 2022 we had shared that we will achieve operating 
profitability (i.e EBITDA before ESOP) by September 2023. We were able to achieve this three 
quarters ahead of plan in the quarter ended December 2022. This performance was driven by 
(1) sustained growth in revenues on account of platform expansion and increased monetization; 
(2) better profitability in the payments business as well as increased contribution of high growth, 
high margin businesses such as loan distribution, and (3) disciplined cost management and better 
operating leverage. 
We report our revenue under two lines, (i) Payment and Financial Services, and (ii) Commerce and 
Cloud Services.

We also earn revenues from our comprehensive offerings of online and in-store payment 
acceptance services such as Payment Gateway, All-in-one and Dynamic-QR, POS, and Soundbox. 
These revenues are primarily from, (i) the transaction fee that we charge our merchants based on 
a percentage of GMV and (ii) recurring subscription fees from merchants for certain products and 
services, such as Paytm Soundbox and card machines. 
Payments has two margin drivers - Payments processing and Subscriptions
Our payments business has two distinct margin drivers - payment processing and subscription. In 
payment processing, we make a net margin (i.e, revenues earned from processing payments less 
charges incurred on such transactions) of 7-9 bps on the Gross Merchandise Value (GMV). We earn 
revenues on processing all kinds of payments, including those made with UPI (Unified Payments 
Interface), in the form of incentives from the government. 
Apart from earning revenues on processing payments, we also earn subscription revenue from 
merchants who use our payment devices, such as Soundbox and card machines. As of March 2023, 
our merchant base has grown to 3.4 crore, with deployed payment devices increasing to 68 lakh 
from 29 lakh in FY 2022, thus accelerating our subscription revenues. Merchants use our devices 
not only for accepting payments but also for fraud avoidance and reconciliation services.

Net Payments Margin, defined as payments revenue (on payment processing as well as subscription 
revenue) less payment processing charges is a key indicator of profitability in this business. 
Payments profitability has improved significantly over the years, with net payments margin growing 
2.9x YoY to ₹1,970 Cr for FY 2023. Improvement in payment profitability is on account of increased 
monetization in the payments business as well as optimization of processing charges. 
Financial Services and Others include revenues that we make from our financial services partners or 
consumers from our financial services offerings, primarily lending. Revenue from financial services 
and others grew 252% to ₹1,540 Cr in FY 2023 from ₹437 Cr in FY 2022, primarily driven by 364% YoY 
growth in the value of loans processed in FY 2023 to ₹35,378 Cr, from ₹7,623 Cr in FY 2022.

Drivers for Growth and Opportunities
Our ecosystem allows us to address large market opportunities: We have built one of the largest 
payments ecosystem in terms of number of consumers and merchants in the country. Customers 
use various payment services that we offer and merchants use us to accept payments and 
grow their business. We also provide financial services through our financial institution partners, 
particularly lending. Payments is a universal need for consumers and merchants, and provides us 
an attractive way of acquiring, retaining and monetising customers and merchants. It continues to 
give us very high engagement, and in addition, we believe we can make substantial revenues and 
profits in payments. Digital distribution of credit is a very large and scalable profit pool in India. Our 
ecosystem allows us to address these multiple large market opportunities at scale and gives us 
multiple growth vectors.
Our network effect creates sustainable advantages for us: We believe that our brand, distribution, 
insights, technology skills, and the scope of our ecosystem give us an advantage to grow our 
business through, (i) cost-effective acquisition of consumers and merchants; (ii) reinforce our 
platform by building higher engagement and stickiness with consumers and merchants; and (iii) 
build high monetisation products at low cost of acquisition.
Our product and technology DNA: Our technology stack is built ground up and integrated across 
all aspects of our ecosystem. We are the only payments company in India that, together with our 
affiliates, owns each layer of the payment stack. This allows us to integrate our payments offering 
seamlessly with other offerings. Similarly, for financial services, our technology infrastructure is built 
on a stack that is owned, controlled and written by us, our respective subsidiaries or associates. 
Our technology ownership and scope of our ecosystem has allowed us (and our associates, and 
financial institution partners) to offer services such as Paytm Wallet, Paytm QR, Paytm Soundbox, 
Gold investments and Fixed Deposit, Paytm Postpaid, Merchant Cash Advance and FASTag. All 
of these products aim to improve the experience of consumers and merchants who use it in our 
ecosystem.
Enabling regulatory environment: In our view, the regulatory environment in India remains 
constructive and supportive of digital payments and financial services. RBI in its Payments Vision 
2025 has reinforced the themes of enabling growth of digital payments across multiple instruments 
including UPI, PPI and cards. Regulatory compliance remains a key focus for us as an organization. 
Internal Control Systems and Risk Management Framework
In a rapidly evolving business, technical and regulatory environment coupled with dynamic consumer 
demands and growing competition, our risk profile is also evolving constantly. Our Company is 
cognizant that effective risk management is core to a sustainable business. We have therefore 
adopted a dynamic risk management framework that functions under the oversight of our Audit 
Committee and Risk Management Committee.

Anti-money laundering and Counter-terrorism Financing Risk Management: To ensure clean day-
to-day operations, we have instituted comprehensive on-boarding and risk management practices, 
which include appropriate anti-money laundering policies and procedures.
Investments and Acquisitions Risk Management: To ensure that our investments and acquisitions 
are strategically complementary to our business, we have an identified team of professionals who 
manage our portfolio in alignment with the Company’s growth plans.
Business and Operational Risks
Macro economic environment: We continue to monitor and adapt to any macro-economic condition 
that affects our customers and merchants as it could also have an impact on our business. We will 
continue to do all that is necessary and in our control in such scenarios. 
Financial: We continue to focus on improving profitability while making disciplined investments in 
areas such as hiring additional personnel, broadening our marketing and promotional activities, 
and expanding our products and services. There could be growth in expenses as we continue to 
expand our business operations. During the course of the business, we may offer performance 
guarantees or undertakings/indemnity to certain organisations/PSUs in relation to business tenders 
or contracts. In the past, the Company hasn’t observed any material claims on account of issuances 
of such guarantees. 
Pace of technology innovation: We make significant investments to constantly improve the 
scale, stability and functionality of our technology. Failure to maintain best-in-class technology 
infrastructure could harm our business and prospects.
Cybersecurity: Our platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for business continuity and 
to manage cybersecurity risks and data security breaches. We use analytics and machine learning 
to ensure optimum automated fraud detection during transaction processing. Encrypted data 
transmission using security protocols and algorithms ensures confidentiality and prevents leakage 
of confidential customer data. Data and technology infrastructures are vulnerable to cyber attacks, 
as any such incident could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business. 
Regulatory:  We are extremely focussed on ensuring compliance with the statutory and regulatory 
framework, and are continuously strengthening our compliance processes and management depth 
as some of our businesses are subject to a fast evolving regulatory landscape. 
Competition: We consistently invest in enhancing our platform and customer-centric services 
in order to maintain our leadership. Our industry is extremely competitive, and consumers and 
merchants have multiple options. 
Litigation: We have a dedicated team to manage litigation risk and engage external consultants where 
necessary, thereby ensuring minimum impact of materiality. As a Company (or key management) 
we may be subject to legal proceedings, including ongoing litigation in tax, civil or other matters.

In our mission to bring half a billion Indians into the mainstream economy, we are governed by 
our values of serving the community, and maintaining trust while moving fast, responsibly and 
focusing on the underserved and unserved. Not only do we solve for our merchants receiving digital 
payments via various sources, and in turn, engaging more users, but also receive seamless access 
to micro-credit, business payment solutions and wealth management, safely.
Paytm is committed to sustainability and is dedicated to ESG. The company’s sustainability 
efforts include reducing its carbon footprint, promoting financial inclusion, and supporting local 
communities.
Mobile Payments: Paytm has played a significant role in promoting mobile payments and reducing 
the reliance on cash transactions. By providing a seamless and secure mobile payment experience, 
Paytm has contributed to greater financial inclusion and transparency, reducing the environmental 
impact associated with the production and circulation of physical currency. Products like Soundbox 
devices allow better reconciliation for merchants, hence enhancing their trust in digital payments.
Financial Inclusion: Paytm has been instrumental in promoting financial inclusion by providing
access to financial services to individuals who were previously excluded from the formal banking 
system. Through its digital wallet and other services, Paytm has enabled people to store, send, and 
receive money digitally, empowering them economically and reducing inequalities.
Paytm’s commitment to ESG principles goes beyond its business operations. The company actively 
engages in social and environmental initiatives to drive positive change. It supports various social 
causes, including education, healthcare, and disaster relief.

State of the Affairs of the Company / 
Operational Highlights
Your Company achieved rapid growth across 
its payments and financial services businesses 
during FY 2022-23 and we are excited by the 
continued long-term potential for revenue 
growth and profitability. 
Our payments business is our acquisition 
engine which brings customers to our platform. 
We monetize these customers by cross selling 
various financial & commerce services. In India, 
the penetration of consumer credit, especially 
products like personal loans, merchant loans, 
and small ticket consumption credit (Postpaid 
and Credit Card) remains low, providing us with 
ample opportunity for leveraging our platform 
by working with lending partners in distributing 
such products. Device subscriptions offer an 
attractive cross-sell opportunity for merchant 
lending, while postpaid customers are an upsell 
opportunity to personal loans and credit cards. 
We have partnered with large NBFCs, and Banks 
and we continue to focus on the quality of loans 
distributed through our platform.
Key aspects of our Company’s consolidated 
performance during FY 2022-23 are as follows:
• The 
Company 
achieved 
operating 
profitability, i.e., EBITDA before ESOP break 
even, in the second half of FY 2022-23, 
well ahead of guidance of September 2023 
quarter shared in our CEO’s letter dated April 
2022.
• Our average monthly transacting users for 
the quarter ended March 2023 were 90 
million, up by 27% YoY from 71 million for 
the quarter ended March 2022; driven by 
our variety of use cases on offer, as mobile 
payments adoption for consumers and 
merchants in India continues to grow.
• Subscription services for payment devices, 
such as Soundbox and POS machines, is 
also witnessing strong adoption, with 6.8 
million merchants paying us subscriptions as 
of March 2023, more than doubling from 2.9 
million as of March 2022.
• Our loan distribution business, in partnership 
with our lending partners, continues to scale 
with loans amounting to H 35,378 Cr, a YoY 
growth of 364%.
• Gross merchandise volume of payments 
facilitated through our platform for FY 2022-
23 has grown 55% YoY to 13.20 Lakh Crore 
from 8.50 Lakh Crore in FY 2021-22.
The growth of UPI and other mobile payment 
methods presents a wealth of untapped 
opportunities. We are prepared to capitalize 
on these opportunities by bringing innovative 
products to our customers. Since the launch of 
our UPI Lite platform in February 2023, we have 
already on boarded 5.50 million customers. 
National Payments Corporation of India's wallet 
interoperability guidelines will allow full KYC 
Paytm Wallet to be universally acceptable on all 
UPI QRs and online merchants.
Our pioneering innovation, Paytm Soundbox, 
has been groundbreaking for our merchants. 
Our device has seen a rapid adoption across the 
country and played a vital role in empowering 
small and micro-businesses in India. It supports 
11 languages including English and Regional 
Languages. With Paytm Soundbox, we provide 
flexibility and convenience to our merchants 
with support for multiple payment methods 
such as Paytm Wallet, Postpaid, Paytm UPI and 
other BHIM UPI apps, net banking & cards.
During the year under review, we also launched 
a 4G-enabled Soundbox 3.0, a first-of-its-kind 
device that offers the fastest real-time payment

alerts, along with best-in-industry battery 
backup of 7 days. 
We have also pioneered the Paytm Dynamic QR 
that empowers merchants to accept contactless 
and error-free payments from customers using 
the Paytm App as well as any other UPI app. 
While Static QR or the physical code that is 
kept on the shop counter requires customers 
to fill the amount to be paid, Dynamic QR helps 
generate a code with the transaction value, 
giving the merchant full control on the payment. 
A merchant can generate the dynamic QR code 
on their POS devices or smartphones for a 
specific order which helps them keep a record of 
every individual transaction including the order 
ID, specific goods sold among other details. 
This has helped make transactions transparent 
and error-free.
We have also made significant improvements 
on the technology front with the launch of our 
new technology platform in March 2023. The 
new platform is a full stack 100% indigenous 
development. This cutting-edge platform will 
enhance customer experience through better 
success rate, speed and security. The new 
platform makes us future ready with regards 
to volumes as it is capable of carrying out 
10 times more transactions than our current 
scale. We have built new operational risk 
and fraud management systems which are 
equipped to cater to India's payment growth. 
With this platform, Paytm is well placed 
to handle fast growing digital payments 
opportunities in the country.
While our loan distribution business has scaled 
significantly in the last few quarters, our 
penetration level for each product remains low, 
and gives us a long growth runway ahead. As of 
quarter ended March 31, 2023:
• Postpaid penetration is at 4.30% of average 
MTU.
• Personal loans penetration is at 0.90% of 
average MTU.
• Merchant loans penetration is at 5.90% of 
total devices deployed.
Our collections efforts continue to deliver 
good performance, with indicative portfolio 
performance across loan products holding 
up well. We continue to seek growth & upsell 
opportunities as low penetration supports future 
growth potential, while working with our lending 
partners to maintain healthy credit quality.

efficient appliances, sensor-based water faucets 
and sensor-based lighting systems in toilets. The 
corporate office building of the Company is an 
Indian Green Building Council Platinum certified 
building and is primarily focused on developing 
sustainable sites, increased water and energy 
efficiency, reduced waste and emissions, use of 
eco-friendly building materials, and improving 
indoor environmental quality more efficiently 
than conventional designs like energy-efficient 
windows, 
LED 
lighting, 
energy-efficient 
appliances, geothermal heat pumps, energy-
efficient insulation etc.
In most of our facilities, VRV/VRF air-conditioned 
systems are installed that are second generation 
energy efficient products. We have also installed 
VAV controllers in all meeting rooms & floors 
to maintain the required cooling as per floor 
occupancy, which ultimately reduces the overall 
load of the air handling unit and chiller. Heat 
resistant facade glasses have been installed 
all across the building that restricts the heat & 
maintains the temperature on the floor, which 
also facilitates the natural light throughout 
the day. All electrical appliances that we are 
sourcing for the office are 5* (star) rated for 
higher energy efficiency. We have a BMS 
building management system for controlling 
and monitoring energy conservation.
The other conservation measures undertaken by 
the Company during FY 2022-23 are mentioned 
in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report, which forms part of the Annual Report.

India’ payments platform.
During FY 2022-23, we launched our new 
technology platform that is built with 100% 
indigenous developed technology. With this, we 
have taken another step towards ‘Atmanirbhar 
Bharat’ to promote digital payments in the 
country. This platform aims to significantly 
enhance consumer experience through a much 
better success rate, speed and security. The 
massive upgrade of our payment’s platform 
through an indigenous full-stack development 
will further boost digital payments in the country.
The platform has been revamped, ensuring that 
the previous technology platform is upgraded 
with new-age tech solutions that are locally 
built and supported in-house. With a world-
class platform that can handle 10X of the current 
scale, we have set a gold standard for fintech’s, 
aimed at handling fast growing digital payments 
opportunities in the country. We have been 
investing heavily in India’s mission of building a

All the functions related to share registry, both in

RTA i.e. Link Intime India Private Limited as per 
the particulars mentioned in the communication 
details section of this report.
Share Transfer System
During FY 2022-23, Link Intime India Private 
Limited, RTA of the Company ensured compliance 
with all the procedural requirements with respect 
to transfer, transmission and transposition 
of shares and formalities with respect to 
name deletion, sub-division, consolidation, 
renewal, exchange and endorsement of share 
certificates.
SEBI has mandated that securities of listed 
companies 
can 
be 
transferred 
only 
in 
dematerialised form. Accordingly, the Company 
/ its RTA are not accepting any lodgement of 
transfer of shares in physical form. Members 
holding shares in physical form are advised to 
avail the facility of dematerialisation. However, 
investors are not barred from holding shares 
in physical form. Transfers in electronic form 
are much simpler and quicker as the Members 
have to approach their respective depository 
participants and the transfers are processed 
by NSDL/ CDSL, as the case may be, with no 
requirement of any separate communication to 
be made to the Company.
The listing fees for FY 2023-24 has been paid by the Company to the NSE and BSE.

5	 Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights 
issues.
 
The organization has a Consequence Management Policy that makes the employees aware

process that will follow if any misconduct is noticed/suspected/reported. The policy is available 
on the intranet, Deep Purple.
 
Our leadership fosters a culture of accessibility, providing employees with direct access to them 
through the HRMS platform for any grievances or concerns.
 
As per the whistle-blower mechanism, the Company expects all the stakeholders to comply with 
the mechanism and shall raise the concerns, if any, for the instances like bribery, suspicion of 
corruption, behavioural issues, discrimination etc via this vigil mechanism. The identity of the 
complainants shall remain confidential during the investigation and may be disclosed only on 
‘need to know’ basis. The Company has enabled web portal “Navex Global” to take anonymous 
complaints and facilitate reporting of the protected disclosures routed through the web links,

Independent Auditor’s Report
Report on the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion 
1. We have audited the accompanying 
Standalone Financial Statements of One 97 
Communications Limited (“the Company”), 
which comprise the Standalone Balance Sheet 
as at March 31, 2023, and the Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other 
Comprehensive Income), the Standalone 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the 
Standalone Statement of Cash Flows for the 
year then ended, and notes to the Standalone 
Financial Statements, including a summary 
of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information. 
2. In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given 
to us, the aforesaid Standalone Financial 
Statements give the information required 
by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act") in 
the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the 
state of affairs of the Company as at March 
31, 2023, and total comprehensive income 
(comprising of loss and other comprehensive 
income), changes in equity and its cash flows 
for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
3. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under 
Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities 
under those Standards are further described 
in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Standalone Financial Statements” 
section of our report. We are independent of 
the Company in accordance with the Code 
of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the Standalone Financial Statements under 
the provisions of the Act and the Rules 
thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements and the Code of Ethics. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters 
4. Key audit matters are those matters that, in 
our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements as a whole and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter 
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Assessment of carrying value of investment 
in subsidiaries and associates carried at cost
(Refer accompanying notes 2.2(k), 2.2(o), 2.2 
(v), 5, 6 and 21 to the Standalone Financial 
Statements)
The Company has equity investments in various 
subsidiaries and associates. The Company 
accounts for equity investments in subsidiaries 
and associates at cost (subject to impairment 
assessment).
For investments carried at cost where an 
indication of impairment exists, the carrying 
value of investment is assessed for impairment 
and where applicable an impairment provision 
is recognized, if required.
The accounting for investments is a key audit 
matter as the determination of recoverable 
value for impairment assessment involves 
significant management judgement.
In measuring these investments, valuation 
methods are used based on inputs that are 
not directly observable from market information 
and certain other unobservable inputs. The 
key inputs and judgements involved in the 
impairment of investments include:
i) Forecast cash flows including assumptions 
on growth rates
ii) Discount rates
iii) Terminal growth rate
Our procedures to assess the carrying value of 
investment (including impairment) in subsidiaries, 
and associates included the following:
• We obtained an understanding from the 
management, assessed and tested the design 
and operating effectiveness of the Company’s 
key controls over the impairment assessment of 
material investments.
• We evaluated the Company’s process regarding 
impairment assessment by involving auditor’s 
valuation experts to assist in assessing the 
appropriateness of the impairment model including 
the independent assessment of the underlying 
assumptions relating to cash flow, discount rate, 
terminal value, etc. for material investments.
• We checked the mathematical accuracy of the 
impairment model and agreed relevant data back 
to the latest budgets, actual past results and other 
supporting documents.
• We assessed the Company’s sensitivity analysis 
and evaluated whether any reasonably foreseeable 
change in assumptions could lead to impairment 
or material change in the carrying value.
• We assessed adequacy of relevant disclosures in 
the Standalone Financial Statements.
Based on the above audit procedures performed, the 
Management’s assessment of the carrying value of 
the investments was considered to be reasonable.

Other Information
5. The Company’s Board of Directors is 
responsible for the other information. The 
other information comprises the Board’s 
Report, Corporate Governance Report, 
Management Discussion and Analysis Report 
and Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report but does not include the Standalone 
Financial Statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. The Board’s Report, Corporate 
Governance Report, Management Discussion 
and Analysis Report, Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report are expected to be 
made available to us after the date of this 
auditor's report. Our opinion on the Standalone 
Financial Statements does not cover the other 
information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. In connection 
with our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information identified above when it 
becomes available and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the Standalone Financial 
Statements  or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. When we read the Board’s Report, 
Corporate Governance Report, Management 
Discussion and Analysis Report, Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report, if we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement 
therein, we are required to communicate the 
matter to those charged with governance and 
take appropriate action as applicable under 
the relevant laws and regulations.
Responsibilities of Management and 
Those Charged With Governance for 
the Standalone Financial Statements
6. The Company’s Board of Directors is 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 
134(5) of the Act with respect to the 
preparation of these Standalone Financial 
Statements that give a true and fair view of 
the financial position, financial performance, 
changes in equity and cash flows of the 
Company in accordance with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Accounting Standards specified under 
Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also 
includes maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the 
Company and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation 
of the Standalone Financial Statements that 
give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error. 
7. In preparing the Standalone Financial 
Statements, management is responsible for 
assessing the Company’s ability to continue 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 205
Annual Report 
2023
182
Financial Statements
Independent Auditor’s Report
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the 
Company or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so. Those 
Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting 
process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Standalone Financial Statements
8. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the Standalone 
Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with 
SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of these Standalone Financial Statements. 
9. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:
 
• Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the Standalone Financial 
Statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control. 
 
• Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the 
Company has adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to financial 
statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls. 
 
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness 
of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.
 
• Conclude on the appropriateness of 
management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to 
the related disclosures in the Standalone 
Financial Statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Company to 
cease to continue as a going concern.

2023

Financial Statements
Independent Auditor’s Report
 
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
Standalone Financial Statements represent 
the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
10. We communicate with those charged with 
governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.
11. We also provide those charged with 
governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards. 
12. From the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory 
Requirements 
13. As required by the Companies (Auditor’s 
Report) Order, 2020 (“the Order”), issued by 
the Central Government of India in terms of

we give in the Annexure B, a statement on

Annexure A to Independent Auditor’s Report
Referred to in paragraph 14(f) of the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members 
of One 97 Communications Limited on the Standalone Financial Statements as of and for the year 
ended March 31, 2023
Report on the Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Financial Statements 
under clause (i) of sub-section 3 of 
Section 143 of the Act
1. We have audited the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements of One 
97 Communications Limited (“the Company”) 
as of March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our 
audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
of the Company for the year ended on that 
date.
Management’s Responsibility for 
Internal Financial Controls
2. The Company’s management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls that 
were operating effectively for ensuring the 
orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to company’s policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
3. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company's internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance 
with the Guidance Note and the Standards on 
Auditing deemed to be prescribed under Section 
143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to 
an audit of internal financial controls, both 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
and both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements was 
established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects. 
4. Our audit involves performing procedures to 
obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the 
internal financial controls system with reference 
to financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial 
statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.

Financial Statements
Annexure A to Independent Auditor’s Report
5. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls system 
with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to financial statements
6. A company's internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company's 
internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and 
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions 
of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being 
made only in accordance with authorisations 
of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to financial 
statements
7. Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion 
or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements to future 
periods are subject to the risk that the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial 
statements may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate. 
Opinion
8. In our opinion, the Company has, in all material 
respects, an adequate internal financial 
controls system with reference to financial 
statements and such internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements were 
operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, 
based on the internal control over financial 
reporting criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
issued by ICAI.

Annexure B to Independent Auditor’s Report
Referred to in paragraph 13 of the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members of One 
97 Communications Limited on the Standalone Financial Statements as of and for the year ended 
March 31, 2023 
i. 
(a) (A) The Company is maintaining proper 
records showing full particulars, 
including quantitative details and 
situation, of Property, Plant and 
Equipment.
 
 
(B) The Company is maintaining proper 
records showing full particulars of 
Intangible Assets.
 
(b) The Property, Plant and Equipment of 
the Company, are physically verified by 
the Management according to a phased 
programme designed to cover all the items 
over a period of three years which, in our 
opinion, is reasonable having regard to 
the size of the Company and the nature of 
its assets. Pursuant to the programme, a 
portion of the Property, Plant and Equipment 
has been physically verified by the 
Management during the year and no material 
discrepancies have been noticed on such 
verification. According to the information 
and explanations given to us, the existence 
of Point of Sale (POS) machines and Sound 
Boxes lying with customers is considered 
on the basis of the ‘active user status’ of 
the customers which is tracked from the 
Company’s IT systems.
 
(c) The title deeds of all the immovable 
properties, as disclosed in Note 3(b) to 
the Standalone Financial Statements, are 
held in the name of the Company.
 
(d) The Company has chosen cost model 
for its Property, Plant and Equipment 
(including Right-of-Use assets) and 
Intangible Assets. Consequently, the 
question of our commenting on whether 
the revaluation is based on the valuation 
by a Registered Valuer, or specifying the 
amount of change, if the change is 10% or 
more in the aggregate of the net carrying 
value of each class of Property, Plant and 
Equipment (including Right-of-Use assets) 
or Intangible Assets does not arise.
 
(e) Based on the information and explanations 
furnished to us, no proceedings have 
been initiated on or are pending against 
the Company for holding benami property 
under the Prohibition of Benami Property 
Transactions Act, 1988 (as amended in 
2016) (formerly the Benami Transactions 
(Prohibition) Act, 1988 (45 of 1988)) and 
Rules made thereunder, and therefore the 
question of our commenting on whether the 
Company has appropriately disclosed the 
details in its Standalone Financial Statements 
does not arise.
ii. (a) The Company is in the business of 
rendering services, and consequently, 
does not hold any inventory. Therefore, 
the provisions of Clause 3(ii)(a) of the 
Order are not applicable to the Company.
 
(b) During the year, the Company has not been 
sanctioned working capital limits in excess 
of Rs. 5 crores, in aggregate from banks and 
financial institutions and accordingly, the 
question of our commenting on whether 
the quarterly returns or statements are in 
agreement with the unaudited books of 
account of the Company does not arise.

iii. (a) The Company has made investments by way of subscribing to optionally convertible debentures 
in 3 companies and in treasury bills, government securities, certificate of deposits and 
commercial papers. The Company has not granted secured/ unsecured loans/advances in

These Standalone Financial Statements 
(“Financial Statements”) were authorised for 
issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
Board of Directors on May 5, 2023.
2.	Significant accounting policies
2.1 Basis of preparation
 
These Financial Statements of the Company 
have been prepared in accordance with Indian 
Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) prescribed 
under Section 133 of the Act read with the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 and other relevant provisions of 
the Act as amended from time to time.
 
The financial statements have been prepared 
on a historical cost basis, except for certain 
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value (refer accounting policies on financial 
instruments and Share-based payments).
 
Accounting policies have been consistently 
applied except where a newly issued 
accounting standard is initially adopted or a 
revision to an existing accounting standard 
requires a change in the accounting policy 
hitherto in use.
 
The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‘Code’) 
relating to employee benefits during 
employment and post employment benefits 
received Presidential assent in September 
2020. The Code has been published in the 
Gazette of India. However, the date on which 
the Code will come into effect has not been 
notified. The Company will assess the impact 
of the Code when it comes into effect and will 
record any related impact in the period the 
Code becomes effective.
 
All the amounts included in the financial 
statements are presented in Indian Rupees 
(‘Rupees’ or ‘Rs.’ or ‘INR’) and are rounded to 
the nearest millions, except per share data 
and unless stated otherwise.
	
Impact of COVID-19
 
The government has removed substantially 
all COVID-19 related restrictions gradually in 
a phased manner and the Company has seen 
improvement in its operations. The Company 
has made an assessment of the recoverability 
and carrying values of its assets as at the end 
of the current year and has concluded that 
there are no material adjustments required 
in the Standalone Financial Statements.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
Management believes that it has considered 
all the possible impact of known events arising 
from COVID-19 pandemic in the preparation 
of the Standalone Financial Statements.
	
New and amended standards 
adopted by the Company
 
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has vide 
notification dated March 23, 2022 notified 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Amendment Rules, 2022 which amends certain 
accounting standards, and are effective April 
1, 2022. These amendments did not have 
any impact on the amounts recognised in 
prior periods and current period, and are not 
expected to significantly affect the future 
periods.
	
New and amended standards issued 
but not effective
 
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has vide 
notification dated March 31, 2023 notified 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Amendment Rules, 2023 (the ‘Rules’) which 
amends certain accounting standards, and 
are effective April 1, 2023.
 
The Rules predominantly amend Ind AS 12, 
Income taxes, and Ind AS 1, Presentation of 
financial statements. The other amendments 
to Ind AS notified by these rules are primarily 
in the nature of clarifications.
 
The amendments clarify how companies 
account for deferred tax on transactions 
such as leases and decommissioning 
obligations. The amendments narrowed the 
scope of the recognition exemption so that 
it no longer applies to transactions that, on 
initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable 
and deductible temporary differences. The 
Company is evaluating the impact, if any, in 
its financial statements.
2.2 Summary of significant accounting 
policies
	
a.	 Current versus non-current 
classification
 
 
The Company presents assets and liabilities 
in the balance sheet based on current / 
non-current classification. 
 
 
An asset is classified as current when it 
is expected to be realised or intended to 
be sold or consumed in normal operating 
cycle, held primarily for the purpose of 
trading, expected to be realised within 
twelve months after the reporting period, 
or cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle 
a liability for at least twelve months after 
the reporting period. All other assets are 
classified as non-current.
 
 
A liability is classified as current when it is 
expected to be settled in normal operating 
cycle, it is held primarily for the purpose 
of trading, it is due to be settled within 
twelve months after the reporting period, 
or there is no unconditional right to defer 
the settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period. 
The Company classifies all other liabilities 
as non-current.
 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities, are 
classified as non-current assets and 
liabilities.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
 
 
The operating cycle is the time between 
the acquisition of assets for processing 
and their realisation in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Company has identified 
twelve months as its operating cycle.
	
b.	 Foreign currencies
 
 
Functional and presentation currency
 
 
Items included in the financial statements 
of the Company are measured using 
the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates i.e. the 
“functional currency”. The Company’s 
financial statements are presented in INR, 
which is also the Company’s functional 
currency. 
 
 
Transactions and balances
 
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
initially recorded by the Company’s 
functional currency at exchange rates 
prevailing at the date the transaction first 
qualifies for recognition.
 
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated at the 
functional currency spot rates of exchange 
at the reporting date. Exchange differences 
arising on settlement or translation of 
monetary items are recognised in profit 
or loss.
 
 
Non-monetary items that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the dates of the initial transactions. 
 
 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value 
in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the date when the 
fair value is determined. The gain or loss 
arising on translation of non-monetary 
items measured at fair value is treated 
in line with the recognition of the gain 
or loss on the change in fair value of the 
item (i.e., translation differences on items 
whose fair value gain or loss is recognised 
in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) 
or statement of profit and loss, are also 
recognised in OCI or statement of profit 
and loss, respectively).
	
c.	 Fair value measurement
 
 
The Company measures certain financial 
instruments (e.g. investments) at fair value 
at each balance sheet date. 
 
 
Fair value is the price that would be received 
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability 
in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. 
 
 
The fair value measurement is based on 
the presumption that the transaction to 
sell the asset or transfer the liabilities takes 
place either in the principal market for the 
asset or liability or in absence of principal 
market, in the most advantageous market 
for the asset or liability.
 
 
A fair value measurement of a non-
financial asset takes into account a market 
participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest 
and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the 
asset in its highest and best use.
 
 
The Company uses valuation techniques 
that are appropriate in the circumstances 
and for which sufficient data are available 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 229
Annual Report 
2023
206
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
to measure fair value, maximising the use of 
relevant observable inputs and minimising 
the use of unobservable inputs.
 
 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value 
is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorised within the 
fair value hierarchy, described as follows, 
based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole:
 
 
Level 1- Quoted (Unadjusted) marked 
prices in the active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities
 
 
Level 2- Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement is directly 
or indirectly observable
 
 
Level 3- Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement is unobservable.
 
 
For assets and liabilities that are recognised 
in the financial statements on a recurring 
basis, the Company determines whether 
transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing 
categorisation (based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
 
 
At each reporting date, the management 
analyses the movements in the values of 
assets and liabilities which are required to 
be re-measured or re-assessed as per the 
Company’s accounting policies. For this 
analysis, the management or its expert 
verifies the major inputs applied in the 
latest valuation by agreeing the information 
in the valuation computation to contracts 
and other relevant documents.
 
 
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, 
the Company has determined classes of 
assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the 
asset or liability and the level of the fair 
value hierarchy as explained above.
	
d.	 Revenue recognition
 
 
Revenue is measured based on the 
consideration specified in a contract with a 
customer (transaction price) net of variable 
consideration e.g. discounts, volume 
rebates, any payments made to a customer 
(unless the payment is for a distinct good 
or service received from the customer) 
and excludes amounts collected on behalf 
of third parties. The Company recognises 
revenue when it transfers control over a 
product or service to a customer. Revenue 
is only recognised to the extent that it is 
highly probable that a significant reversal 
will not occur. 
 
 
The Company provides incentives to its 
users in various forms including cashbacks. 
Incentives which are consideration payable 
to the customer that are not in exchange 
for a distinct good or service are generally 
recognized as a reduction of revenue.
 
 
Where the Company acts as an agent 
for selling goods or services, only the 
commission income is included within 
revenue. The specific revenue recognition 
criteria described below must also be met 
before revenue is recognized. Typically, the

Financial Statements
Company has a right to payment before 
or at the point that services are delivered. 
Cash received before the services are 
delivered is recognised as a contract 
liability. The amount of consideration 
does not contain a significant financing 
component as payment terms are less 
than one year.
	
	
Sale of services 
 
 
Revenue from services is recognized 
when the control in services is transferred 
as per the terms of the agreement with 
customer i.e. as and when services are 
rendered. Revenues are disclosed net of 
the Goods and Services Tax charged on 
such services. In terms of the contract, 
excess of revenue over the billed at the 
year-end is carried in the balance sheet 
as trade receivables where the amount 
is recoverable from the customer without 
any future performance obligation and the 
Company has unconditional right over such 
consideration (i.e. if only the passage of 
time is required before payment of such 
consideration is due). Cash received before 
the services are delivered is recognised as 
a contract liability.
	
	
Commission
 
 
The Company facilitates recharge of 
talk time, bill payments and availability 
of bus tickets and earns commission for 
the respective services. Commission 
income is recognized when the control in 
services is transferred to the customer 
when the services have been provided 
by the Company.
	
	
Service fees from merchants
 
 
The Company earns service fee from 
merchants and recognizes such revenue 
when the control in services have been 
transferred by the Company i.e. as and 
when services have been provided by the 
Company. Such service fee is generally 
determined as a percentage of transaction 
value executed by the merchants. Amount 
received by the Company pending 
settlement are disclosed as payable to the 
merchants under other financial liabilities.
	
	
Government Grants
 
 
The Company recognises government 
grants only when there is reasonable 
assurance that the conditions attached to 
them will be complied with, and the grants 
will be received. Government grants related 
to revenue are recognized on a systematic 
basis in the Standalone Statement of Profit 
and Loss as other operating revenue over 
the periods necessary to match them with 
the related costs, if any, which they are 
intended to compensate.
	
	
Interest income
 
 
For all debt instruments measured either 
at amortised cost or at fair value through 
other comprehensive income, interest 
income is recorded using the effective 
interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that 
exactly discounts the estimated future 
cash payments or receipts over the 
expected life of the financial instrument 
or a shorter period, where appropriate, to 
the gross carrying amount of the financial 
asset or to the amortised cost of a financial

2023

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
liability. When calculating the effective 
interest rate, the Company estimates 
the expected cash flows by considering 
all the contractual terms of the financial 
instrument but does not consider the 
expected credit losses. Interest income is 
included in other income in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
e.	 Trade receivable
 
 
Trade receivables are amounts due from 
customers for services performed in the 
ordinary course of business and reflects 
group’s unconditional right to consideration 
(that is, payment is due only on the 
passage of time). Trade receivables are 
recognised initially at the transaction price 
as they do not contain significant financing 
components. The Company holds the trade 
receivables with the objective of collecting 
the contractual cash flows and therefore 
measures them subsequently at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, 
less loss allowance. 
	
f.	 Taxes
	
	
Current income tax
 
 
Current income tax assets and liabilities 
are measured at the amount expected to 
be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws 
used to compute the amount are those that 
are enacted or substantively enacted, at 
the reporting date in the countries where 
the Company operates and generates 
taxable income.
 
 
Current income tax relating to items 
recognised outside statement of profit 
and loss is recognised either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity. Current 
tax items are recognised in correlation to 
the underlying transaction either in OCI or 
directly in equity. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in the tax 
returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to 
interpretation and considers whether it 
is probable that a taxation authority will 
accept an uncertain tax treatment. The 
Company measures its tax balances either 
based on the most likely amount or the 
expected value, depending on which 
method provides a better prediction of 
the resolution of the uncertainty. 
	
	
Deferred tax
 
 
Deferred tax is provided using the liability 
method on temporary differences between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes at the reporting date.
 
 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences, except:
 
 
When the deferred tax liability arises from 
the initial recognition of goodwill or an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination and, at the 
time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for 
all deductible temporary differences, 
the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry

Annual Report 
2023
209
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
forward of unused tax credits and unused 
tax losses can be utilised. The carrying 
amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred tax asset 
to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax 
assets are re-assessed at each reporting 
date and are recognised to the extent that 
it has become probable that future taxable 
profits will allow the deferred tax asset to 
be recovered.
 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the year when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at 
the reporting date.
 
 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised 
outside statement of profit and loss is 
recognised either in other comprehensive 
income or in equity. Deferred tax items are 
recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
 
 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax 
liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable 
right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and the 
deferred taxes relate to the same taxable 
entity and the same taxation authority.
	
	
Taxes paid on acquisition of assets or 
on incurring expenses
 
 
Assets are recognised net of the amount 
of GST paid, except when the tax incurred 
on a purchase of assets is not recoverable 
from the taxation authority, in which case, 
the tax paid is recognised as part of the 
cost of acquisition of the asset.
 
 
Expenses are recognised net of the 
amount of GST paid, except when the tax 
incurred on a purchase of services is not 
recoverable from the taxation authority, in 
which case, the tax paid is expensed off 
in statement of profit and loss.
 
 
The net amount of tax recoverable from, 
or payable to, the taxation authority is 
included as part of other current/ non- 
current assets or other current liabilities 
in the balance sheet.
	
g.	 Non-current assets held for sale 
and discontinued operations
 
 
The Company classifies non-current assets 
and disposal groups as held for sale if 
their carrying amounts will be recovered 
principally through a sale rather than 
through continuing use. Actions required 
to complete the sale should indicate that 
it is unlikely that significant changes to the 
sale will be made or that the decision to 
sell will be withdrawn. Management must 
be committed to the sale expected within 
one year from the date of classification.
 
 
For these purposes, sale transactions include 
exchanges of non-current assets for other 
non-current assets when the exchange 
has commercial substance. The criteria for 
held for sale classification is regarded met 
only when the assets or disposal group is 
available for immediate sale in its present 
condition, subject only to terms that are 
usual and customary for sales of such 
assets (or disposal groups), its sale is highly

Annual Report 
2023

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
probable; and it will genuinely be sold, not 
abandoned. The Company treats sale of the 
asset or disposal group to be highly probable 
when:
 
 
• The appropriate level of management 
is committed to a plan to sell the asset 
(or disposal group),
 
 
• An active programme to locate a 
buyer and complete the plan has been 
initiated (if applicable),
 
 
• The asset (or disposal group) is being 
actively marketed for sale at a price 
that is reasonable in relation to its 
current fair value,
 
 
• The sale is expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within 
one year from the date of classification 
, and
 
 
• Actions required to complete the plan 
indicate that it is unlikely that significant 
changes to the plan will be made or 
that the plan will be withdrawn.
 
 
Non-current assets held for sale and 
disposal groups are measured at the lower 
of their carrying amount and the fair value 
less costs to sell. Assets and liabilities 
classified as held for sale are presented 
separately in the Balance Sheet. 
 
 
Property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets once classified as held 
for sale are not depreciated or amortised.
 
 
A disposal group qualifies as discontinued 
operation if it is a component of an entity 
that either has been disposed of, or is 
classified as held for sale, and:
 
 
• Represents a separate major line 
of business or geographical area of 
operations or
 
 
• Is part of a single co-ordinated plan 
to dispose of a separate major line 
of business or geographical area of 
operations.
 
 
Discontinued operations are excluded 
from the results of continuing operations 
and are presented as a single amount as 
profit or loss after tax from discontinued 
operations in the statement of profit and 
loss.
	
h.	 Property, plant and equipment
 
 
Property, plant and equipment are carried 
at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any accumulated impairment, if 
any. Property, plant and equipment is 
depreciated on a written down value basis 
to its residual value over its estimated 
useful life. 
 
 
Costs directly attributable to acquisition 
are capitalized until the property, plant and 
equipment are ready for use, as intended 
by the management.  
 
 
Subsequent costs are capitalised on 
the carrying amount or recognised as a 
separate asset, as appropriate, only when 
future economic benefits associated 
with the item are probable to flow to 
the Company and cost of the item can 
be measured reliably. When significant 
parts of property, plant and equipment 
are required to be replaced at intervals, 
the Company depreciates them separately 
based on their specific useful lives. The 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 234
Annual Report 
2023
211
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
carrying amount of any component 
accounted for as a separate asset is 
derecognised when replaced. All repair and 
maintenance are charged to statement of 
profit and loss during the reporting period 
in which they are incurred.
 
 
Advances paid towards the acquisition of 
property, plant and equipment outstanding 
at each balance sheet date is classified as 
capital advances under the non-current 
assets and the cost of assets not ready to 
use before such date are disclosed under 
‘Capital work in progress’.
 
 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and is 
recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss on the date of disposal or retirement.
 
 
Depreciation is provided using the written 
down value method, except for plant and 
machinery on which straight line method 
is used, based on technical evaluation 
done by the management and charged 
to statement of profit and loss, unless 
such expenditure forms part of carrying 
value of another asset, as per the useful 
life prescribed under schedule II of the 
Companies Act, 2013, given below:

Leasehold improvements are depreciated 
over the shorter of their useful life or the 
lease term, unless the entity expects to 
use the assets beyond the lease term.
 
 
With effect from April 1, 2022, the Company 
has changed the method of depreciation for 
Plant & Machinery from written down value 
method to straight line method along with 
change in life to 3 years and 2 years for EDC/
POS machines and Soundbox, respectively. 
The impact on account of above change in 
estimate is immaterial for the current and 
future periods.
 
 
The residual values, useful lives and 
methods of depreciation of property, 
plant and equipment are reviewed at 
each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
	
i.	 Intangible assets
 
 
Separately acquired intangible assets, such 
as software are measured initially at cost. 
Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortization and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any. Costs associated with 
maintaining software programmes are 
recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Development costs that are directly 
attributable to the design and testing of 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 235
Annual Report 
2023
212
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
identifiable and unique software products 
controlled by the Company are recognised 
as intangible assets where the following 
criteria are met:
 
 
• it is technically feasible to complete 
the software so that it will be available 
for use or sale
 
 
• management intends to complete the 
software and use or sell it
 
 
• there is an ability to use or sell the 
software
 
 
• it can be demonstrated how the 
software will generate probable future 
economic benefits
 
 
• adequate technical, financial and 
other resources to complete the 
development and to use or sell the 
software are available, and
 
 
• the expenditure attributable to the 
software during its development can 
be reliably measured.
 
 
Directly attributable costs that are 
capitalised as part of the software include 
employee costs.
	
	
Research and development costs
 
 
Research expenditure and development 
expenditure that do not meet the criteria 
above are recognised as an expense as 
incurred. Development costs previously 
recognised as an expense are not recognised 
as an asset in a subsequent period.
	
	
Amortization methods and periods
 
 
Amortization of intangible assets begins 
when development is complete and the 
asset is available for use. Software, licenses 
acquired and internally generated software 
are amortized at the rate of 40% per annum 
on written down value method. During the 
period of development, the asset is tested 
for impairment annually. The amortization 
period and the amortization method are 
reviewed at least at each financial year end. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the 
expected pattern of consumption of future 
economic benefits embodied in the asset 
are considered to modify the amortization 
period or method, as appropriate, and are 
treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
The amortization expense on intangible 
assets is recognized in the statement of 
profit and loss unless such expenditure 
forms part of carrying value of another 
asset.
 
 
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition 
of an intangible asset are measured as 
the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and are recognized in the statement 
of profit and loss when the asset is 
derecognized.
	
j.	 Borrowing costs
 
 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to 
the acquisition, construction or production 
of an asset that necessarily takes a 
substantial period of time to get ready 
for its intended use or sale are capitalised 
as part of the cost of the asset. All other 
borrowing costs are expensed in the period 
in the statement of profit and loss in which 
they occur. Borrowing costs consist of 
interest and other costs that an entity 
incurs in connection with the borrowing 
of funds.

Financial Statements
	
k.	 Impairment of non-financial 
assets
 
 
For all non-financial assets, the Company 
assesses whether there are indicators of 
impairment. If such an indicator exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss, if any. Where the 
asset does not generate cash flows that 
are independent from other assets, the 
Company estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which 
the asset belongs.
 
 
The recoverable amount for an asset or 
CGU is the higher of its value in use and 
fair value less costs of disposal. If the 
recoverable amount of an asset or CGU 
is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount, the asset or CGU is considered 
impaired and the carrying amount of the 
asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the statement of profit and 
loss. 
 
 
In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows of the asset or CGU are 
discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. In determining fair value less costs 
of disposal, recent market transactions are 
taken into account. 
 
 
If no such transactions can be identified, 
an appropriate valuation model is used. 
These calculations are corroborated by 
valuation multiples, quoted share prices 
for publicly traded companies or other 
available fair value indicators.
 
 
The Company bases its impairment 
calculation on detailed budgets and 
forecast calculations. These budgets and 
forecast calculations generally cover a 
period of five years. For longer periods, 
a long-term growth rate is calculated 
and applied to project future cash flows 
after the fifth year. To estimate cash 
flow projections beyond periods covered 
by the most recent budgets/forecasts, 
the Company extrapolates cash flow 
projections in the budget using a steady 
or declining growth rate for subsequent 
years, unless an increasing rate can be 
justified. In any case, this growth rate does 
not exceed the long-term average growth 
rate for the products, industries, or country 
or countries in which the entity operates, 
or for the market in which the asset is 
used.
 
 
An assessment is made at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is an 
indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or 
have decreased. If such indication exists, 
the Company estimates the asset’s or 
CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously 
recognised impairment loss is reversed 
only if there has been a change in the 
assumptions used to determine the asset’s 
or CGU’s recoverable amount since the 
last impairment loss was recognised. The 
reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed 
its recoverable amount, nor exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been

Annual Report 
2023
214
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
determined, net of depreciation, had 
no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset in prior years. Such reversal is 
recognised in the statement of profit or 
loss.
	
l.	 Provisions and contingencies
 
 
Provisions
 
 
Provisions are recognised when the 
Company has a present obligation (legal 
or constructive) as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation. 
 
 
When the Company expects some or 
all of a provision to be reimbursed, the 
reimbursement is recognised as a separate 
asset, but only when the reimbursement is 
virtually certain. The expense relating to a 
provision is presented in the statement of 
profit and loss net of any reimbursement.
 
 
If the effect of the time value of money 
is material, provisions are discounted 
using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, 
when appropriate, the risks specific to 
the liability. When discounting is used, 
the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a finance 
cost.
 
 
Contingencies
 
 
A contingent liability is a possible 
obligation that arises from past events 
whose existence will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or 
more uncertain future events beyond 
the control of the Company or a present 
obligation that is not recognized because it 
is not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation. A 
contingent liability also arises in extremely 
rare cases where there is a liability that 
cannot be recognized because it cannot 
be measured reliably. The Company does 
not recognize a contingent liability but 
discloses its existence in the financial 
statements.
 m.	 Retirement and other employee 
benefits
 
 
For defined benefit plans (gratuity), 
the liability or asset recognised in the 
balance sheet is the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation at the end of 
the reporting period less the fair value of 
plan assets. The defined benefit obligation 
is calculated by an independent actuary 
using the projected unit credit method. 
 
 
The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows by 
reference to market yields at the end of 
the reporting period on government bonds 
that have terms approximating to the terms 
of the related obligation.
 
 
The net interest cost is calculated by 
applying the discount rate to the net 
balance of the defined benefit obligation 
and the fair value of plan assets. This cost 
is included in employee benefit expense in 
the statement of profit and loss.
 
 
Re-measurement gains and losses arising 
from experience adjustments and changes 
in actuarial assumptions are recognised 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 238
Annual Report 
2023
215
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
in the period in which they occur, directly 
in other comprehensive income. They 
are included in retained earnings in the 
statement of changes in equity and in 
the balance sheet. Re-measurements 
are not reclassified to profit or loss in the 
subsequent periods.
 
 
Changes in the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation resulting from 
plan amendments or curtailments are 
recognised immediately in profit or loss 
as past service cost.
 
 
The Company’s contributions to defined 
contribution plans (provident fund) are 
recognized in profit or loss when the 
employee renders related service. The 
Company has no further obligations 
under these plans beyond its periodic 
contributions.
 
 
The Company provides for liability at period 
end on account of un-availed earned leave 
and Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) as 
per actuarial valuation using projected unit 
credit method.
 
 
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including 
non-monetary benefits that are expected 
to be settled wholly within 12 months 
after the end of the period in which the 
employees render the related service 
are recognised in respect of employees’ 
services up to the end of the reporting 
period and are measured at the amounts 
expected to be paid when the liabilities 
are settled. The liabilities are presented 
as employee benefit payable under other 
financial liabilities in the balance sheet.
	
n.	 Share-based payments
	
	
i)	 Equity-settled transactions
 
 
 
Employees (including senior executives) 
of the Company receive remuneration 
in the form of share-based payments, 
whereby employees render services 
as consideration for equity instruments 
(equity-settled transactions).
 
 
 
The cost  of equity-settled transactions 
is determined by the fair value at the 
date when the grant is made using an 
appropriate valuation model.
 
 
 
That cost is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in 
Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) 
reserves in equity, over the period in 
which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee 
benefits expense. The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date 
until the vesting date reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Company’s best estimate of 
the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The statement of 
profit and loss expense or credit for 
a period represents the movement in 
cumulative expense recognised as at 
the beginning and end of that period 
and is recognised in employee benefits 
expense.
 
 
 
Performance conditions which are 
market conditions are taken into 
account when determining the 
grant date fair value of the awards. 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 239
Annual Report 
2023
216
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
Service and non-market performance 
conditions are not taken into account 
when determining the grant date fair 
value of awards, but the likelihood of 
the conditions being met is assessed 
as part of the Company’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest.
 
 
 
No expense is recognised for awards 
that do not ultimately vest because 
non-market performance and/or service 
conditions have not been met.
 
 
 
When the terms of an equity-settled 
award are modified, the minimum 
expense recognised is the expense 
had the terms not been modified, if the 
original terms of the award are met. 
An additional expense is recognised 
for any modification that increases 
the total fair value of the share-based 
payment transaction, or is otherwise 
beneficial to the employee as measured 
at the date of modification. Where an 
award is cancelled by the entity or 
by the counterparty, any remaining 
element of the fair value of the award 
is expensed immediately through profit 
or loss.
 
 
 
The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected as additional share 
dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
	
	
ii)	 Cash-settled transactions
 
 
 
For awards classified as cash settled 
share based transactions, the goods 
or services acquired are measured and 
the liability incurred, at the fair value of 
liability. Until the liability is settled, the 
fair value of the liability is re-measured 
at the end of each reporting period 
and at the date of settlement, with 
any changes in fair value recognised 
in statement of profit and loss for the 
period.
 
 
 
The cost of cash-settled transactions 
is determined by the fair value of equity 
instruments at each reporting date 
using an appropriate valuation model.
 
 
 
That cost is recognised, together with a 
corresponding increase in liability, over 
the period in which the performance 
and/or service conditions are fulfilled 
in employee benefits expense. The 
cumulative expense recognised for 
cash-settled transactions at each 
reporting date until the vesting 
date reflects the extent to which 
the vesting period has expired and 
the Company’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The statement of 
profit and loss expense or credit for 
a period represents the movement in 
cumulative expense recognised as at 
the beginning and end of that period 
and is recognised in employee benefits 
expense.
 
 
 
No expense is recognised for awards 
that do not ultimately vest because 
non-market performance and/or 
service conditions have not been met.
 
 
 
The Company has set up Paytm 
Associate Benefit Welfare Trust

Welfare Trust) for administering

certain types of share-based payment 
arrangements including awards given 
to employees of the outside group 
companies as well for awards of 
options of other companies given to 
its employees. The Company uses 
the Trust as a vehicle for distributing 
shares under the ESOP schemes. The 
Trust holds shares of the Company, 
for giving shares to employees. The 
Company treats the Trust as its 
extension and shares of the Company 
held by Trust are treated as treasury 
shares. Other assets held by the 
Trust are consolidated on a line-by-
line basis with Company’s financial 
statements. Shares of other companies 
held by the Trust for distribution to its 
employees are separately disclosed 
under investments.
 
 
 
The Company has lost control over the 
Trust and accordingly, it is now not 
consolidated on a line-by-line basis 
with Company’s financial statements. 
	
o.	 Financial instruments
 
 
A financial instrument is any contract that 
gives rise to a financial asset of one entity 
and a financial liability or equity instrument 
of another entity.
	
	
Financial assets
 
 
Initial recognition and measurement
 
 
All financial assets are recognised initially 
at fair value plus, in the case of financial 
assets not recorded at fair value through 
profit or loss, transaction costs that are 
attributable to the acquisition of the 
financial asset. However, trade receivables 
that do not contain a significant financing 
component are measured at transaction 
price.
 
 
Subsequent measurement
 
 
For purposes of subsequent measurement, 
financial assets are classified in four 
categories:
 
 
• Debt instruments at amortized cost
 
 
• Debt instruments at fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
 
 
• 
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity 
instruments at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL)
 
 
• Equity instruments measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI)
 
 
Debt instruments at amortised cost
 
 
A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the 
amortised cost if both the following 
conditions are met:
 
 
a) The asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold 
assets for collecting contractual cash 
flows, and
 
 
b) Contractual terms of the asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal 
and interest (SPPI) on the principal 
amount outstanding.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
 
 
After initial measurement, such financial 
assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised 
cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral 
part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is 
included in finance income in the profit or 
loss. The losses arising from impairment 
are recognised in the profit or loss. This 
category generally applies to trade and 
other receivables and is most relevant to 
the Company.
 
 
Debt instrument at FVTOCI
 
 
A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the 
FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are 
met:
 
 
a) The objective of the business model is 
achieved both by collecting contractual 
cash flows and selling the financial 
assets,   and
 
 
b) The asset’s contractual cash flows 
represent SPPI.
 
 
Debt instruments included within the 
FVTOCI category are measured initially as 
well as at each reporting date at fair value. 
Fair value movements are recognized in 
the other comprehensive income (OCI). 
However, the Company recognizes 
interest income, impairment losses and 
reversals and foreign exchange gain or 
loss in the statement of profit and loss. 
On derecognition of the asset, cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in OCI 
is reclassified from the equity to the 
statement of profit and loss. Interest 
earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt 
instrument is reported as interest income 
using the EIR method.
 
 
Debt instrument at FVTPL
 
 
FVTPL is a residual category for debt 
instruments. Any debt instrument, 
which does not meet the criteria for 
categorization as at amortized cost or as 
FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
 
 
In addition, the Company may elect 
to designate a debt instrument, which 
otherwise meets amortized cost or 
FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, 
such election is allowed only if doing so 
reduces or eliminates a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency (referred to as 
‘accounting mismatch’). 
 
 
Debt instruments included within the 
FVTPL category are measured at fair 
value with all changes recognized in the 
statement of profit and loss.
 
 
Equity investments
 
 
All equity investments in scope of Ind 
AS 109 are measured at fair value. The 
Company may make an irrevocable 
election to present in other comprehensive 
income subsequent changes in the fair 
value. The Company makes such election 
on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The 
classification is made on initial recognition 
and is irrevocable.
 
 
If the Company decides to classify an 
equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all 
fair value changes on the instrument, 
excluding dividends, are recognized in the 
OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts

Annual Report 
2023
219
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
from OCI to statement of profit or loss, 
even on sale of investment. However, the 
Company may transfer the cumulative gain 
or loss within equity.
 
 
Equity instruments included within the 
FVTPL category are measured at fair 
value with all changes recognized in the 
statement of profit and loss.
 
 
The equity securities which are not held 
for trading, and for which the Company 
has made an irrevocable election at initial 
recognition to recognize changes in fair 
value through OCI rather than profit or 
loss as these are strategic investments 
and the Company considered this to be 
more relevant.
 
 
Equity investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures are measured 
at cost. The investments are reviewed at 
each reporting date to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment 
considering the provisions of Ind AS 
36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. If any such 
indication exists, policy for impairment 
of non-financial assets is followed.
 
 
Derecognition
 
 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a 
part of a financial asset or part of a group 
of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised (i.e. removed from the 
Company’s balance sheet) when:
 
 
• The rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset have expired, or
 
 
• The Company has transferred its rights 
to receive cash flows from the asset 
or has assumed an obligation to pay 
the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party under 
a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and 
either (a) the Company has transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset, or (b) the Company has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all 
the risks and rewards of the asset, but 
has transferred control of the asset.
 
 
When the Company has transferred its 
rights to receive cash flows from an 
asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what 
extent it has retained the risks and 
rewards of ownership. When it has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all 
of the risks and rewards of the asset, 
nor transferred control of the asset, the 
Company continues to recognise the 
transferred asset to the extent of the 
Company’s continuing involvement. In that 
case, the Company also recognises an 
associated liability. The transferred asset 
and the associated liability are measured 
on a basis that reflects the rights and 
obligations that the Company has retained.
 
 
Impairment of financial assets
 
 
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the 
Company applies expected credit loss 
(ECL) model for measurement and 
recognition of impairment loss on financial 
assets that are debt instruments, and are 
measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, 
debt securities, deposits, trade receivables 
and bank balance.
 
 
The Company follows ‘simplified 
approach’ for recognition of impairment 
loss allowance on trade receivables. The 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 243
Annual Report 
2023
220
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
application of simplified approach does not 
require the Company to track changes in 
credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment 
loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at 
each reporting date, right from its initial 
recognition. 
 
 
For recognition of impairment loss on other 
financial assets and risk exposure, the 
Company determines that whether there 
has been a significant increase in the credit 
risk since initial recognition. If credit risk 
has not increased significantly, 12-month 
expected credit loss (ECL) is used to 
provide for impairment loss. However, 
if credit risk has increased significantly, 
lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent 
period, credit quality of the instrument 
improves such that there is no longer a 
significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition, then the entity reverts 
to recognising impairment loss allowance 
based on 12-month ECL.
 
 
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit 
losses resulting from all possible default 
events over the expected life of a financial 
instrument. The 12-month ECL is a portion 
of the lifetime ECL which results from 
default events that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date. 
 
 
ECL is the difference between all 
contractual cash flows that are due to 
the Company in accordance with the 
contract and all the cash flows that the 
entity expects to receive (i.e., all cash 
shortfalls), discounted at the original EIR.
 
 
The Company uses a provision matrix 
to determine impairment loss allowance 
on portfolio of its trade receivables. The 
provision matrix is based on its historically 
observed default rates over the expected 
life of the trade receivables and is adjusted 
for forward-looking estimates. At every 
reporting date, the historical observed 
default rates are updated and changes 
in the forward-looking estimates are 
analyzed.
 
 
ECL impairment loss allowance (or 
reversal) recognized during the period 
is recognized as income/ expense in the 
statement of profit and loss. This amount 
is reflected under the head other expenses 
in the statement of profit and loss. For the 
financial assets measured as at amortised 
cost, ECL is presented as an allowance, 
i.e., as an integral part of the measurement 
of those assets in the balance sheet. The 
allowance reduces the net carrying amount. 
Until the asset meets write-off criteria, 
the Company does not reduce impairment 
allowance from the gross carrying amount.
	
	
Financial liabilities
 
 
Initial recognition and measurement
 
 
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial 
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss, loans and 
borrowings, payables, or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in an 
effective hedge, as appropriate.
 
 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially 
at fair value and, in the case of loans and 
borrowings and payables, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs.
 
 
The Company’s financial liabilities include 
borrowings, lease liabilities, trade and 
other payables. 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 244
Annual Report 
2023
221
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
 
 
Subsequent measurement
 
 
The measurement of financial liabilities 
depends on their classification as 
described below: 
 
 
Loans and borrowings
 
 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the EIR 
method. Gains and losses are recognised 
in profit or loss when the liabilities are 
derecognised as well as through the EIR 
amortisation process.
 
 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included as finance costs 
in the statement of profit and loss.
 
 
Derecognition
 
 
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged 
or cancelled or expires. When an existing 
financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially 
different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such 
an exchange or modification is treated as 
the derecognition of the original liability 
and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying 
amounts is recognised in the statement 
of profit or loss.
 
 
Embedded derivatives
 
 
An embedded derivative is a component of 
a hybrid (combined) instrument that also 
includes a non-derivative host contract 
– with the effect that some of the cash 
flows of the combined instrument vary in 
a way similar to a stand-alone derivative. 
An embedded derivative causes some 
or all of the cash flows that otherwise 
would be required by the contract to be 
modified according to a specified interest 
rate, financial instrument price, commodity 
price, foreign exchange rate, index of 
prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, 
or other variable, provided in the case of 
a non-financial variable that the variable 
is not specific to a party to the contract.  
 
 
Reassessment only occurs if there is either 
a change in the terms of the contract 
that significantly modifies the cash flows 
that would otherwise be required or a 
reclassification of a financial asset out of 
the fair value through profit or loss.
 
 
If the hybrid contract contains a host that 
is a financial asset within the scope of Ind 
AS 109, the Company does not separate 
embedded derivatives. Rather, it applies 
the classification requirements contained 
in Ind AS 109 to the entire hybrid contract. 
Derivatives embedded in all other host 
contracts are accounted for as separate 
derivatives and recorded at fair value if 
their economic characteristics and risks 
are not closely related to those of the host

Annual Report 
2023
222
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
contracts and the host contracts are not 
held for trading or designated at fair value 
though profit or loss. These embedded 
derivatives are measured at fair value with 
changes in fair value recognized in profit 
or loss, unless designated as effective 
hedging instruments.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is reported in 
the balance sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	
p.	 Cash and cash equivalents
 
 
Cash and cash equivalent in the standalone 
balance sheet comprise cash at banks and 
on hand and short-term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less, 
which are subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes in value.
 
 
For the purpose of the standalone 
statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and short-
term deposits, as defined above, net 
of outstanding bank overdrafts as they 
are considered an integral part of the 
Company’s cash management.
	
q.	 Leases
	
	
The Company as a lessee
 
 
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily 
consist of leases for land and office 
premises. The Company assesses whether 
a contract contains a lease, at inception of a 
contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease 
if the contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period 
of time in exchange for consideration. To 
assess whether a contract conveys the 
right to control the use of an identified 
asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) 
the contact involves the use of an identified 
asset (ii) the Company has substantially all 
of the economic benefits from use of the 
asset through the period of the lease and 
(iii) the Company has the right to direct the 
use of the asset.
 
 
At the date of commencement of the 
lease, the Company recognizes a right-
of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding 
lease liability for all lease arrangements in 
which it is a lessee, except for leases with 
a term of twelve months or less (short-
term leases) and low value leases. For 
these short-term and low value leases, the 
Company recognizes the lease payments 
as an operating expense on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
 
 
Certain lease arrangements includes the 
options to extend or terminate the lease 
before the end of the lease term. ROU 
assets and lease liabilities includes these 
options when it is reasonably certain that 
they will be exercised.
 
 
The right-of-use assets are initially 
recognized at cost, which comprises the 
initial amount of the lease liability adjusted 
for any lease payments made at or prior 
to the commencement date of the lease 
plus any initial direct costs less any 
lease incentives. They are subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, if any.

Annual Report 
2023
223
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
 
 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from 
the commencement date on a straight-line 
basis over the shorter of the lease term and 
useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-
use assets are evaluated for recoverability 
whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amounts may 
not be recoverable. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, the recoverable amount 
(i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to 
sell and the value-in-use) is determined on 
an individual asset basis unless the asset 
does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. 
In such cases, the recoverable amount is 
determined for the Cash Generating Unit 
(CGU) to which the asset belongs.
 
 
The lease liability is initially measured 
at amortized cost at the present value 
of the future lease payments. The 
lease payments are discounted using 
the interest rate implicit in the lease 
or, if not readily determinable, using 
the incremental borrowing rates in the 
country of domicile of these leases. 
Lease liabilities are remeasured with a 
corresponding adjustment to the related 
right-of-use asset if the Company changes 
its assessment if whether it will exercise 
an extension or a termination option.
 
 
Lease liability and ROU asset have been 
separately presented in the standalone 
balance sheet and lease payments have 
been classified as financing cash flows.
	
r.	 Earnings/ (loss) per share (EPS)
 
 
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by 
dividing the profit/(loss) for the year 
attributable to equity holders by the 
weighted average number of Equity shares 
outstanding during the year.
 
 
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by 
dividing the profit/(loss) attributable to 
equity holders by the weighted average 
number of Equity shares outstanding during 
the year plus the weighted average number 
of Equity shares that would be issued on 
conversion of all the dilutive potential Equity 
shares into Equity shares. 
	
s.	 Treasury shares
 
 
Own equity instruments that are reacquired 
(treasury shares) are recognised at cost 
and deducted from equity. No gain or 
loss is recognised in profit or loss on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the 
Company’s own equity instruments. Any 
difference between the carrying amount 
and the consideration, if reissued, is 
recognised in other reserve. 
	
t.	 Segment reporting
 
 
Operating segments are reported in a 
manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The Chief Operating 
decision-maker is responsible for allocating 
resources and assessing performance 
of the operating segments and makes 
strategic decisions.
	
u.	 Use of estimates 
 
 
The Company is required to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, disclosure 
of contingent liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenue and expenses during 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 247
Annual Report 
2023
224
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
the reporting period. Actual results could 
differ from those estimates. The Company 
bases its estimates on historical experience 
and on various other assumptions that 
are believed to be reasonable, the results 
of which form the basis for making 
judgements about carrying values of 
assets and liabilities.
	
v.	 Exceptional Items
 
 
On certain occasions, the size, type or 
incidence of an item of income or expense, 
pertaining to the ordinary activities of 
the Company is such that its disclosure 
improves the understanding of the 
performance of the Company. Such income 
or expense is classified as an exceptional 
item and accordingly disclosed in the 
financial statements. Significant impact 
on the financial statements arising from 
impairment of investments in subsidiaries 
and associates, gain/ loss on disposal of 
subsidiaries and associates (other than 
major lines of business that meet the 
definition of a discontinued operation) are 
considered and reported as exceptional 
items.
	
w.	Contributed Equity
 
 
Equity shares are classified as equity.
 
 
The transaction costs of an equity 
transaction are accounted for as a 
deduction from equity (net of any related 
income tax benefit) to the extent they 
are incremental costs directly attributable 
to the equity transaction that otherwise 
would have been avoided. Qualifying 
transaction costs incurred in anticipation 
of an issuance of equity instruments is 
deferred on the balance sheet until the 
equity instrument is recognised. Deferred 
costs are subsequently reclassified as a 
deduction from equity when the equity 
instruments are recognised. If the equity 
instruments are not subsequently issued, 
the deferred transaction costs are charged 
off to profit or loss.
 
 
The transaction costs incurred with respect 
to the IPO of the Company as reduced by 
the amount recovered from the selling 
shareholders are allocated between new 
issue of shares and listing of existing 
equity shares. The costs attributable to 
listing of existing shares is recognised in 
profit or loss and the costs attributable to 
new issuance of shares is recognised in 
equity.

*  This amount is including cross charge of INR Nil (March 31, 2022: 7). Net depreciation charge 
of Right-of-use assets in profit & loss is INR 388 (March 31, 2022: 194).
 
The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Company 
becomes obliged to exercise (or not exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty is only 
revised if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs, which affects this 
assessment, and that is within the control of the lessee. The Company has given notice to vacate 
certain office premises. This has been accounted as lease termination. Hence, in accordance with 
Ind AS 116, Lease Liability has been re-measured by INR 9 ( March 31, 2022: 9) with corresponding 
adjustment to Right-of-Use assets amounting to INR 8 (March 31, 2022: 6) and the remaining 
balance has been included in Miscellaneous Income disclosed under Other Income in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
 
The total cash outflow for leases for the year ended is INR 554 (March 31, 2022: 314)
	
Extension and termination options:
 
Extension and termination options are included in certain leases. These are used to maximise 
operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Company’s operations. In certain 
cases, the extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Company and not 
by the respective lessor.

23. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Company’s Standalone Financial Statements requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, 
assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Estimates and assumptions	
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next 12 months, are described below. 
Deferred taxes
Deferred tax assets can be recognised for deductible temporary differences (including unused 
tax losses) only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. As the Company is yet to generate operating 
profits, Management has assessed that as at March 31, 2023 it is not probable that such deferred 
tax assets can be realised in excess of available taxable temporary differences. Management re-
assesses unrecognised deferred tax assets at each reporting date and recognises to the extent that 
it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
For details about deferred tax assets, refer note 27.
During FY 2019-20 (AY 2020-21) a shareholder of the Company holding 30.33% of shares of the 
Company had transferred its shareholding to its group company (both entities being 100% subsidiaries 
of the same ultimate parent entity). Based on advice from the Company's tax experts, Management 
has assessed that a mere change in shareholding within the same group will not be an affirmative 
position to say that the shareholding has been changed. Further, since the shares of the Company 
carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power were beneficially held by persons, i.e. 
ultimate holding company of the aforesaid entities, who beneficially held shares of the company 
carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power on the last day of the year or years in 
which the loss was incurred, the Company shall be entitled to carry forward and set off these losses 
against the taxable income of future years in accordance with the provisions of Section 79 of the 
Income Tax Act, 1961. (refer note 27)
Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are 
determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that 
may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount 
rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and

Financial Statements
its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. 
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated in India, the management considers the 
interest rates of government bonds in India. The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality 
tables for India. The mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response to demographic 
changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation rates. 
For further details about gratuity obligations, refer note 26.
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the standalone balance 
sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured 
using valuation techniques including the DCF model, Price of Recent Investment (PORI) method 
and Comparable Company Multiples (CCM) method. The inputs to these models are taken from 
observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required 
in establishing fair values. For further details about Fair value measurement, refer note 30.
Impairment of financial assets
The Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit risk associated with its assets 
carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been 
a significant increase in credit risk. Note 31 details how the Company determines whether there has 
been a significant increase in credit risk. 
Impairment reviews
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are tested for impairment at-least on an annual basis 
or when events that occur / changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount is less 
than its carrying value. In calculating the value in use, the Company is required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions inter-alia concerning the growth in EBITDA, long-term growth rates; 
discount rates to reflect the risks involved. For details about impairment reviews, refer note 21.
Incentives	
The Company provides incentives to users in various forms including cash backs to promote our 
platform. Incentives to users to whom the Company has a performance obligation is recorded as a 
reduction of revenue to the extent of the revenue earned. For the incentives to other transacting 
users to whom the Company has no performance obligation, management is required to determine 
whether the incentives are in substance a payment on behalf of the merchants and should therefore 
be recorded as a reduction of revenue or as marketing and promotional expenses. Some of the factors

Cash Flow Method, OPM Method or Backsolve method and share prices based on secondary 
transactions, where available.
2. Dividend yield is considered zero, as no dividend payout is expected in the foreseeable future.
3. Risk free return is based on the yield to maturity of Indian treasury securities, with a maturity 
corresponding to the expected term of ESOP.
4. Annualized volatility is based on the median weekly volatility of selected comparable companies

26. Gratuity
The Company provides for gratuity for employees in India as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. 
Employees who are in continuous service for a period of 5 years are eligible for gratuity. The amount 
of gratuity payable on retirement/termination is the employees last drawn basic salary per month 
computed proportionately for 15 days salary multiplied for the number of years of service upto a 
limit of INR 20 Lakhs. The gratuity plan is a funded plan and the Company makes contributions to 
recognised fund/insurer in India. The Company does not fully fund the liability and maintains a target 
level of funding to be maintained over a period of time based on estimations of expected gratuity 
payments. Disclosures given below are as per actuarial valuation report of independent Actuary.
The following tables summarize the components of net benefit expenses recognized in the Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss and the funded status and amount recognized in the Standalone 
Balance Sheet.

The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates 
the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions 
occurring at the end of the reporting period. The methods and types of assumptions used in 
preparing the sensivity analysis did not change compared to the prior year.
 
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the period ending March 31, 2024 
are INR 254 (March 31, 2023 - INR 162).
 
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 2.79 years (March 31, 2022- 
2.78 years).
 
The average remaining working life of members of the defined benefit obligation as at March 31, 
2023 is 30.87 years (as at March 31, 2022- 29.91 years)

Risk exposure
 
Through its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most 
significant of which are detailed below:
 
Asset volatility: The plan assets are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond 
yields. If plan assets underperform this yield, there will be a deficit of the plan asset investments 
in fixed income securities with high grades and in government securities. These are subject to 
interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk to an acceptable level.
 
Changes in bond yields: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based 
on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
 
Inflation risks: The payments are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
 
Life expectancy: Obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in 
life expectancy and inflation will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. This is particularly 
significant where inflationary conditions result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.

a.	 Leases
	
Operating lease: Company as Lessee	
 
The Company has taken certain office space on short term operating lease. The leases have 
varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. On renewal, the terms of the leases are 
renegotiated. Rental expense towards leases charged to Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss 
for the year ended March 31, 2023 amount to INR 5 (March 31, 2022: INR 42).
b.	 Capital commitments
 
Estimated amount of contracts towards property, plant & equipment remaining to be executed 
on capital account and not provided for is INR 2,586 (Net of capital advance of INR 566) [March 
31, 2022: INR 3,057 (Net of capital advances of INR 763)].
c.	 Contingent liabilities
 
ii) The Company will continue to assess the impact of further developments relating to retrospective 
application of Supreme Court judgement dated February 28, 2019 clarifying the definition 
of 'basic wages' under Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1952 
and deal with it accordingly. In the assessment of the management, the aforesaid matter is 
not likely to have a significant impact and accordingly, no provision has been made in these 
Standalone Financial Statements.
 
iii) The Company has been made aware of certain matters/claims relating to infringement of 
trademarks and patents in relation to the business activities carried on by it. The Company 
actively monitors such matters/claims along with appropriate legal/technology experts to assess 
their veracity and takes action as considered necessary. In the opinion of the management, 
no material liability is likely to arise on account of such matters/claims, based on assessments 
made to date.
	
	
Notes:
 
 
1) It is not practicable for the Company to estimate the timing of cash outflows, if any.
 
 
2) The Company does not expect any reimbursements in respect of the above contingent 
liabilities.

30. Fair value (Contd..)
The management has assessed that fair value of all other financial assets and liabilities including 
cash and cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, 
loans, other financial assets, trade payables, lease liabilities and other financial liabilities, approximate 
their carrying amounts.
31. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk 
and liquidity risk. The Company continues to focus on a system-based approach to business risk 
management. The Company’s financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, 
evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business. Backed by strong internal 
control systems, the current Risk Management Framework rests on policies and procedures issued 
by appropriate authorities; process of regular internal reviews/audits to set appropriate risk limits and 
controls; monitoring of such risks and compliance confirmation for the same. 
a.	 Market Risk
 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market prices. Market prices comprise three types of risk: interest rate 
risk, foreign currency risk and price risk. The Company has in place appropriate risk management 
policies to limit the impact of these risks on its financial performance. The Company ensures 
optimization of cash through fund planning and robust cash management practices.
	
(i)	Interest Rate Risk
 
 
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument 
will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. There is no interest rate risk as the 
Company did not have borrowings at the end of the current and previous year.

(ii) Price risk
 
 
The Company invests its surplus funds in fixed deposits, Commercial papers, Treasury bills 
and Government Securities. There is no exposure of price risk on such instruments.
 
 
The Company is also exposed to equity/ preference shares price risk arising from investments 
held by the Company and classified in the balance sheet either as fair value through OCI or at 
fair value through profit or loss (refer note 7(a) and 7(b)). To manage its price risk arising from 
investments in equity/ preference shares, the company diversifies its portfolio. Diversification 
of the portfolio is done in accordance with the limits set by the company.
	
(iii) Foreign currency risk
 
 
The Indian Rupee is the Company’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the 
Company’s results are presented in Indian Rupee and exposures are managed against Indian 
Rupee accordingly. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows 
of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company’s 
exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Company’s 
operating activities and investing activities (when revenue, expense and Property, Plant and 
Equipment is denominated in a foreign currency).
 
 
The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities denominated in United 
States Dollar (USD), Canadian Dollar (CAD) and Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) are as follows:

The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity of profit or loss to a reasonably possible 
change in MYR and exchange rates, with all other variables held constant. 
 
 
The Company’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material. 
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a reasonably possible change in the under-lying 
foreign currency against the functional currency while assuming all other variables to be 
constant.
 
 
Based on the movements in the foreign exchange rates historically and the prevailing market 
conditions as at the reporting date, the Company’s management has concluded that the above 
mentioned rates used for sensitivity are reasonable benchmarks.
b.	 Credit Risk
 
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or 
contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities 
(primarily trade receivables) including deposits with banks. Management has a credit policy in place 
and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. The Company applies expected 
credit loss (ECL) model on financial assets measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, 
deposits, trade receivables and bank balance. Cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the 
impairment requirement of Ind AS 109, the identified impairment loss was immaterial.
 
All of the entity's investments and loans at amortised cost are considered to have low credit risk, 
and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 months expected 
losses. Management considers instruments to be low credit risk when they have a low risk of 
default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the 
near term.

The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers. Customer

relating to customer credit risk management. An impairment analysis is performed at each 
reporting date by grouping the receivables in homogeneous group. The calculation is based 
on lifetime expected credit losses.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of trade 
receivables. The Company does not hold collateral as security.
	
(ii) Other investments (excluding loans to related parties)
 
 
All of the entity’s other investments (preference shares, government securities, commercial 
papers, treasury bills and security deposits) at amortised cost are considered to have low 
credit risk, and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 
months’ expected losses. Management consider ‘low credit risk’ for listed instruments to be 
an investment grade credit rating with at least one major rating agency. Other instruments 
are considered to have low credit risk when they have a low risk of default and the issuer has 
a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.
	
(iii) Loan to related parties
 
 
The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of loan and whether 
there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each 
reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Company 
compares the risk of a default occurring on the loan as at the reporting date with the risk of 
default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and supportive 
forwarding-looking information.
	
(iv) Other financial assets
 
 
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Company’s 
treasury department in accordance with the Company’s policy. Investment of surplus funds 
is made only with banks of high repute.

Independent Auditor’s Report
Report on the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
1. We have audited the accompanying 
Consolidated Financial Statements of 
One 97 Communications Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Holding Company”) and 
its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its 
subsidiaries together referred to as “the 
Group”), its associate companies and joint 
ventures (refer Note 23 to the attached 
Consolidated Financial Statements), which 
comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
as at March 31, 2023, and the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other 
Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity  and the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 
for the year then ended, and notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, including 
a summary of significant accounting policies 
and other explanatory information (hereinafter 
referred to as “the Consolidated Financial 
Statements ”).
2. In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, 
the aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements 
give the information required by the Companies 
Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required 
and give a true and fair view in conformity with 
the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of 
the Group, its associate companies and joint 
ventures as at March 31, 2023, of consolidated 
total comprehensive income (comprising of loss 
and other comprehensive income), consolidated 
changes in equity and its consolidated cash 
flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
3. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under 
Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities 
under those Standards are further described 
in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements” 
section of our report. We are independent 
of the Group, its associate companies and 
joint ventures in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements in India 
in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained and the audit evidence obtained 
by the other auditors in terms of their 
reports referred to in sub-paragraph 16 of 
the Other Matters section below, other than 
the unaudited financial statements/ financial 
information as certified by the management 
and referred to in sub-paragraph 17 of the 
Other Matters section below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

describes that the Subsidiary Company's 
application for authorization to set up Payment 
System (‘PA application’), to the Department 
of Payment and Settlement Systems, Reserve

Subsidiary Company has further been advised 
by the RBI to resubmit its application after the 
receipt of approval from the Government of 
India ('GoI'), on past downward investment 
from One 97 Communications Limited (the 
holding company), in compliance with Foreign 
Direct Investment (FDI) Guidelines. If GoI does 
not provide such approval, the Subsidiary 
Company has been directed to inform RBI 
immediately. The response to the Subsidiary 
Company's application to the GoI for the 
aforesaid approval, is presently awaited. 
 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the 
above matter.
5. The following emphasis of matter paragraph 
has been included in the independent 
auditor’s report dated April 22, 2023 issued

IT Audit (RBI) report during the year 
recommending strengthening of IT outsourcing

including KYC/AML at the Bank. The Bank's 
compliance to the RBI's report is currently 
being validated by the RBI. Our conclusion is 
not modified in respect of above matter."
 
Note 2(e) referred above corresponds to 
Note 42(b) to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
Key Audit Matters
6. Key audit matters are those matters that, in 
our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter 
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Assessment of impairment of goodwill relating 
to acquisition of subsidiaries and assessment 
of appropriateness of the carrying value of 
investments in associates
(Refer accompanying notes 2.2, 2.4, 2.5(k), 
2.5(o), 2.5(v), 4, 5(b), 20, 24A and 36 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements)
Our procedures to assess impairment of goodwill relating 
to acquisition of subsidiaries and appropriateness of the 
assessment of carrying value of investments in associates 
included the following:
• We obtained an understanding from the management, 
assessed and tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of the Company's key controls over 
the impairment and valuation assessment.
The Group performed an impairment 
assessment over the goodwill balance by 
calculating the recoverable value of the 
cash generating unit (CGU) to which the 
Goodwill belongs using a discounted cash 
flow model and comparing the same with the 
carrying value. For the purpose of impairment 
assessment, each subsidiary is considered 
as separate CGU.
The management has estimated future cash 
flows for a 5 year period and a terminal growth 
rate is applied in determining the terminal 
value.
Further, there are certain investments in 
associates which are carried at cost (subject 
to impairment assessment).
We considered impairment assessment of 
goodwill and carrying value of associate’s 
investment as key audit matter given the extent 
of management judgement and the estimates 
involved around impairment assessment with 
respect to determining appropriate discount 
rates, cash flow projections (Cash flow 
forecasts) and earnings growth rates applied 
beyond the initial five-year period (Terminal 
growth rates).
• We evaluated the Company’s process regarding 
impairment and carrying value assessment by 
involving auditor’s valuation experts to assist in 
assessing the appropriateness of the valuation 
and impairment model including the independent 
assessment of the underlying assumptions relating 
to cash flow, discount rate, terminal value, etc. for 
material investments.
• We checked the mathematical accuracy of the 
valuation and impairment model and agreed 
relevant data back to the latest budgets, actual 
past results and other supporting documents.
• We assessed the Company’s sensitivity analysis 
and evaluated whether any reasonably foreseeable 
change in assumptions could lead to impairment 
or material change in the carrying value.
• We assessed adequacy of relevant disclosures in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Based on the above audit procedures performed, 
the Management’s assessment of the impairment of 
goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries and carrying 
value of the investments in associates was considered 
to be reasonable.

in the Holding Company’s Board’s Report, 
Corporate Governance Report, Management

report. Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements does not cover the other information 
and we will not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with 
the Consolidated Financial Statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. When we 
read the Holding Company’s Board’s Report, 
Corporate Governance Report, Management 
Discussion and Analysis Report, Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report, if we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement 
therein, we are required to communicate the 
matter to those charged with governance and 
take appropriate action as applicable under the 
relevant laws and regulations.
Responsibilities of Management and 
Those Charged With Governance for 
the Consolidated Financial Statements 
8. The Holding Company’s Board of Directors 
is responsible for the preparation and 
presentation of these Consolidated Financial 
Statements in term of the requirements of 
the Act that give a true and fair view of the 
consolidated financial position, consolidated 
financial performance and consolidated cash 
flows, and consolidated changes in equity of 
the Group including its associate companies 
and joint ventures in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Accounting Standards 
specified under Section 133 of the Act. The 
respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group and of its associate 
companies and joint ventures are responsible 
for maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; and the 
design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements  that 
give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, which have been used for the purpose 
of preparation of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements by the Directors of the Holding 
Company, as aforesaid.

Financial Statements
9. In preparing the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, the respective Board of Directors 
of the companies included in the Group and 
of its associate companies and  joint ventures 
are responsible for assessing the ability of the 
Group and of its associate companies and 
joint ventures to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
10. The respective Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group and of 
its associate companies and joint ventures 
are responsible for overseeing the financial 
reporting process of the Group and of its 
associate companies and joint ventures.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements 
11. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the Consolidated 
Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with 
SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
12. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:
 
• Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
 
• Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether 
the Holding Company has adequate 
internal financial controls with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements in 
place and the operating effectiveness of 
such controls.
 
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness 
of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.
 
• Conclude on the appropriateness of 
management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt

Financial Statements
on the ability of the Group and its associate 
companies and joint ventures to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to 
the related disclosures in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Group and its 
associate companies and joint ventures 
to cease to continue as a going concern. 
 
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the Consolidated Financial 
Statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation. 
 
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the 
entities or business activities within the 
Group and its associate companies and 
joint ventures to express an opinion on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the audit of the financial 
statements of such entities included in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements of 
which we are the independent auditors. 
For the other entities included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, which 
have been audited by other auditors, such 
other auditors remain responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of 
the audits carried out by them. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
13. We communicate with those charged with 
governance of the Holding Company and such 
other entities included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other 
matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
14. We also provide those charged with 
governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
15. From the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matters
16. We did not audit the financial statements/ 
financial information of 12 subsidiaries included 
in the consolidated financial statements, whose

Report on the Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements under clause (i) of sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
1. In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the Company as of and 
for the year ended March 31, 2023, we have 
audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements of One 97 
Communications Limited (hereinafter referred 
to as “the Holding Company”) and its subsidiary 
companies, its associate companies and joint 
venture, which are companies incorporated in 
India, as of that date. Reporting under clause 
(i) of sub section 3 of Section 143 of the Act in 
respect of the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements 
is not applicable to 5 associates incorporated in 
India namely Paytm Insuretech Private Limited,

Infinity Transoft Solution Private Limited, 
Eatgood Technologies Private Limited and 
Socomo Technologies Private Limited, pursuant

Management’s Responsibility for 
Internal Financial Controls
2. The respective Board of Directors of the 
Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, 
its associate companies and joint venture, to 
whom reporting under clause (i) of sub section 
3 of Section 143 of the Act in respect of the 
adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements is 
applicable, which are companies incorporated 
in India, are responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls based on 
internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
(“the Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). 
These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the respective company’s policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
3. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company's internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance 
with the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI 
and the Standards on Auditing deemed to 
be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the 
Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable 
to an audit of internal financial controls, both 
applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 340

Financial Statements
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial 
statements was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in 
all material respects.
4. Our audit involves performing procedures to 
obtain audit evidence about the adequacy 
of the internal financial controls system 
with reference to financial statements and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained and the audit evidence obtained by 
the other auditors in terms of their reports 
referred to in the Other Matters paragraph 
below is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the Holding 
Company’s internal financial controls system 
with reference to consolidated financial 
statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to financial statements
6. A company's internal financial control with 
reference to financial statements is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company's internal financial control with 
reference to financial statements includes 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to 
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to financial 
statements
7. Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial 
statements, including the possibility of 
collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error 
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial 
statements to future periods are subject to 
the risk that the internal financial control with 
reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, 
or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

a resolution of the Board of Directors on May 
5, 2023.
2.	Significant accounting policies
2.1 Basis of preparation
 
The Consolidated Financial Statements of 
the Group have been prepared in accordance 
with Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) 
prescribed under Section 133 of the Act 
read with the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 and other relevant 
provisions of the Act as amended from time 
to time.
 
The Consolidated Financial Statements 
have been prepared on a historical cost 
basis, except for certain financial assets 
and liabilities measured at fair value (refer 
accounting policies on financial instruments 
and Share-based payments).
 
Accounting policies have been consistently 
applied except where a newly issued 
accounting standard is initially adopted or a 
revision to an existing accounting standard 
requires a change in the accounting policy 
hitherto in use.
 
The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‘Code’) 
relating to employee benefits during 
employment and post employment benefits 
received Presidential assent in September 
2020. The Code has been published in the 
Gazette of India. However,the date on which 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 355
Annual Report 
2023
332
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
the Code will come into effect has not been 
notified. The Group will assess the impact of 
the Code when it comes into effect and will 
record any related impact in the period the 
Code becomes effective.
 
All the amounts included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements are presented in Indian 
Rupees (‘Rupees’ or ‘Rs.’ or ‘INR’) and are 
rounded to the nearest millions, except per 
share data and unless stated otherwise.
	
Impact of COVID-19
 
The government has removed substantially 
all COVID-19 related restrictions gradually in 
a phased manner and the Group has seen 
improvement in its operations. The Group has 
made an assessment of the recoverability and 
carrying values of its assets as at the end of 
the current period and has concluded that 
there are no material adjustments required 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Management believes that it has considered 
all the possible impact of known events arising 
from COVID-19 pandemic in the preparation of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
	
New and amended standards 
adopted by the Company
 
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has vide 
notification dated March 23, 2022 notified 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Amendment Rules, 2022 which amends certain 
accounting standards, and are effective April 
1, 2022. These amendments did not have 
any impact on the amounts recognised in 
prior periods and current period, and are not 
expected to significantly affect the future 
periods.
	
New and amended standards issued 
but not effective
 
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has vide 
notification dated March 31, 2023 notified 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Amendment Rules, 2023 (the ‘Rules’) which 
amends certain accounting standards, and 
are effective April 1, 2023.
 
The Rules predominantly amend Ind AS 12, 
Income taxes, and Ind AS 1, Presentation of 
financial statements. The other amendments 
to Ind AS notified by these rules are primarily 
in the nature of clarifications.
 
The amendments clarify how companies 
account for deferred tax on transactions such 
as leases and decommissioning obligations. 
The amendments narrowed the scope 
of the recognition exemption so that it no 
longer applies to transactions that, on initial 
recognition, give rise to equal taxable and 
deductible temporary differences. The Group 
is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial 
statements.
2.2 Business Combination and Goodwill
 
Business combinations (other than those under 
common control) are accounted for using the 
acquisition method under Ind AS 103. The cost 
of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate 
of the consideration transferred measured at 
acquisition date fair value. Acquisition-related 
costs are expensed as incurred.
 
At the acquisition date, the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
are recognised at their acquisition date fair 
values. However, the following assets and 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 356
Annual Report 
2023
333
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
liabilities acquired in a business combination 
are measured at the basis indicated below: 
 
• The assets or liabilities related to employee 
benefit arrangements are recognised and 
measured in accordance with Ind AS 19 
Employee Benefits.
 
• Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognized and measured in accordance 
with Ind AS 12 Income Taxes.
 
When the Group acquires a business, it 
assesses the financial assets and liabilities 
assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual 
terms, economic circumstances and pertinent 
conditions as at the acquisition date. The 
consideration transferred by the acquirer is 
recognized at fair value at the acquisition 
date. Deferred consideration is classified as 
a liability under Ind AS 109 and is measured 
at amortized cost.
 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred over the net identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. After initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that they might be 
impaired.
 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill 
acquired in a business combination is, from 
the acquisition date, allocated to each of 
the Group’s cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or 
liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those 
units.
 
A cash generating unit to which goodwill 
has been allocated is tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an 
indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating 
unit is less than its carrying amount, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the unit and then to the other assets of the 
unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of 
each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss 
for goodwill is recognised in statement of 
profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised 
for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent 
periods.
2.3 Basis of consolidation
 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including 
structured entities) over which the Group has 
Control. The determination of control for the 
purpose of consolidation is done as per Ind 
AS 110. Control is achieved when the Group 
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the investee.
 
Specifically, the Group controls an investee 
if and only if the Group has:
 
a) Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights 
that give it the current ability to direct the 
relevant activities of the investee)

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 357
Annual Report 
2023
334
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
 
b) Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee, and
 
c) The ability to use its power over the 
investee to affect its returns
 
Generally, there is a presumption that a 
majority of voting rights result in control. 
To support this presumption and when the 
Group has less than a majority of the voting 
or similar rights of an investee, the Group 
considers all relevant facts and circumstances 
in assessing whether it has power over an 
investee, including:
 
a) The contractual arrangement with the 
other vote holders of the investee
 
b) Rights arising from other contractual 
arrangements
 
c) The Group’s voting rights and potential 
voting rights
 
d) The size of the group’s holding of voting 
rights relative to the size and dispersion 
of the holdings of the other voting rights 
holders
 
The Group re-assesses whether or not it 
controls an investee if facts and circumstances 
indicate that there are changes to one or more 
of the three elements of control. Consolidation 
of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains 
control over the subsidiary and ceases when 
the Group loses control of the subsidiary. 
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of 
a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during 
the year are included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements from the date the Group 
gains control until the date the Group ceases 
to control the subsidiary. 
 
Consolidated Financial Statements are 
prepared using uniform accounting policies 
for like transactions and other events in 
similar circumstances. If a member of the 
group uses accounting policies other than 
those adopted in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for like transactions and events in 
similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments 
are made to that group member’s Financial 
Statements in preparing the Consolidated 
Financial Statements to ensure conformity 
with the group’s accounting policies.
 
The Financial Statements of all entities used 
for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up 
to same reporting date as that of the Group. 
When the end of the reporting period of the 
parent is different from that of a subsidiary, 
the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation 
purposes, additional financial information as 
of the same date as the consolidated financial 
statements of the parent to enable the parent 
to consolidate the financial information of the 
subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so.
	
Consolidation procedures:
 
(a) Combine like items of assets, liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows 
of the parent with those of its subsidiaries. 
For this purpose, income and expenses of 
the subsidiary are based on the amounts 
of the assets and liabilities recognised in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements at 
the acquisition date.
 
(b) Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of 
the parent’s investment in each subsidiary 
and the parent’s portion of equity of each 
subsidiary. 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 358
Annual Report 
2023
335
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
 
(c) Eliminate in full intragroup assets and 
liabilities, equity, income, expenses and 
cash flows relating to transactions between 
entities of the group (profits or losses 
resulting from intragroup transactions that 
are recognised in Fixed assets, such as 
inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated 
in full). Intragroup losses may indicate an 
impairment that requires recognition in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Ind 
AS12 Income Taxes applies to temporary 
differences that arise from the elimination 
of profits and losses resulting from 
intragroup transactions.
 
Profit or loss and each component of other 
comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to 
the equity holders of the parent of the Group 
and to the non-controlling interests, even if 
this results in the non-controlling interests 
having a deficit balance. When necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring their 
accounting policies into line with the Group’s 
accounting policies. All intra-group assets 
and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and 
cash flows relating to transactions between 
members of the Group are eliminated in full 
on consolidation. The Group measures non-
controlling interests at their proportion of the 
fair value of the identifiable net assets. 
2.4 Investment in associates and joint 
ventures
 
An associate is an entity over which the Group 
has significant influence. Significant influence 
is the power to participate in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the investee, but 
is not control or joint control.
 
The considerations made in determining whether 
significant influence is similar to those necessary 
to determine control over the Subsidiaries.
 
The Group’s investments in its associate 
are accounted for using the equity method. 
Under the equity method, the investment in 
an associate is initially recognised at cost. 
 
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for 
using the equity method, after initially being 
recognised at cost in the consolidated balance 
sheet. 
 
The carrying amount of the investment is 
adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s 
share of net assets of the associate or joint 
venture since the acquisition date. Goodwill 
relating to the associate or joint venture 
is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment and is not tested for impairment 
individually.
 
The consolidated statement of profit and loss 
reflects the Group’s share of the results of 
operations of the associate or joint venture. 
Any change in OCI of the associate or joint 
venture is presented as part of the Group’s 
OCI. In addition, when there has been a 
change recognised directly in the equity of 
the associate or joint venture, the Group 
recognises its share of any changes, when 
applicable, in the statement of changes in 
equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting 
from transactions between the Group and 
the associate or joint venture are eliminated 
to the extent of the interest in the associate 
or joint venture.

Annual Report 
2023
336
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
 
If an entity’s share of losses of an associate or 
joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in 
the associate or joint venture (which includes 
any long term interest that, in substance, 
form part of the Group’s net investment in the 
associate), the entity discontinues recognising 
its share of further losses. Additional losses are 
recognised only to the extent that the Group 
has incurred legal or constructive obligations 
or made payments on behalf of the associate 
or joint venture. If the associate or joint venture 
subsequently reports profits, the entity resumes 
recognising its share of those profits only after 
its share of the profits equals the share of losses 
not recognised.
 
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit 
or loss of an associate or joint venture is 
shown on the face of the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss. The financial 
statements of the associate are prepared for 
the same reporting period as the Group. When 
necessary, adjustments are made to bring the 
accounting policies in line with those of the 
Group. 
 
After application of the equity method, the 
Group determines whether it is necessary 
to recognise an impairment loss on its 
investment in its associate or joint venture. 
At each reporting date, the Group determines 
whether there is objective evidence that the 
investment in the associate or joint venture 
is impaired.
 
If there is such evidence, the Group calculates 
the amount of impairment as the difference 
between the recoverable amount of the 
associate or joint venture and its carrying 
value, and then recognises the loss as 
‘exceptional items’ in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss.
 
Upon loss of significant influence over the 
associate, the Group measures and recognises 
any retained investment at its fair value. Any 
difference between the carrying amount of the 
associate upon loss of significant influence 
and the fair value of the retained investment 
and proceeds from disposal is recognised in 
consolidated statement of profit or loss.
2.5 Summary of significant accounting 
policies
	
a.	 Current versus non-current 
classification
 
 
The Group presents assets and liabilities 
in the consolidated balance sheet based 
on current / non-current classification.
 
 
An asset is classified as current when it 
is expected to be realised or intended to 
be sold or consumed in normal operating 
cycle, held primarily for the purpose of 
trading, expected to be realised within 
twelve months after the reporting period, 
or cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a 
liability for at least twelve months after 
the reporting period. All other assets are 
classified as non-current.

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 360
Annual Report 
2023
337
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
 
 
A liability is classified as current when it is 
expected to be settled in normal operating 
cycle, it is held primarily for the purpose 
of trading, it is due to be settled within 
twelve months after the reporting period, 
or there is no unconditional right to defer 
the settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period. 
The Group classifies all other liabilities as 
non-current.
 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities, are 
classified as non-current assets and 
liabilities.
 
 
The operating cycle is the time between 
the acquisition of assets for processing 
and their realisation in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Group has identified 
twelve months as its operating cycle. 
	
b.	 Foreign currencies
 
 
Functional and presentation currency
 
 
Items included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Group are measured 
using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates i.e. 
the “functional currency”. The Group’s 
consolidated financial statements are 
presented in INR, which is also the Holding 
Company’s functional currency.
 
 
Transactions and balances
 
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
initially recorded by the Group’s entities 
at their respective functional currency at 
exchange rates prevailing at the date the 
transaction first qualifies for recognition.
 
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated at the 
functional currency spot rates of exchange 
at the reporting date. Exchange differences 
arising on settlement or translation of 
monetary items are recognised in profit 
or loss.
 
 
Non-monetary items that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the dates of the initial transactions. 
 
 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value 
in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the date when the 
fair value is determined. The gain or loss 
arising on translation of non-monetary 
items measured at fair value is treated 
in line with the recognition of the gain 
or loss on the change in fair value of the 
item (i.e., translation differences on items 
whose fair value gain or loss is recognised 
in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) or 
consolidated statement of profit and loss, 
are also recognised in OCI or consolidated 
statement of profit and loss, respectively).
	
	
Group companies
 
 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities 
of foreign operations are translated into 
INR at the rate of exchange prevailing at 
the reporting date and their consolidated 
statements of profit and loss are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of 
the transactions. The exchange differences 
arising on translation for consolidation 
are recognised in OCI. On disposal of a

2023
338
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
foreign operation, the component of OCI 
relating to that particular foreign operation 
is recognised in profit or loss.
	
c.	 Fair value measurement
 
 
The Group measures certain financial 
instruments (e.g. investments) at fair value 
at each balance sheet date. 
 
 
Fair value is the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer 
a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement 
date. 
 
 
The fair value measurement is based on 
the presumption that the transaction to sell 
the asset or transfer the liabilities takes 
place either in the principal market for the 
asset or liability or in absence of principal 
market, in the most advantageous market 
for the asset or liability.
 
 
A fair value measurement of a non-
financial asset takes into account a market 
participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest 
and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the 
asset in its highest and best use.
 
 
The Group uses valuation techniques that 
are appropriate in the circumstances and 
for which sufficient data are available to 
measure fair value, maximising the use of 
relevant observable inputs and minimising 
the use of unobservable inputs.
 
 
All assets and liabilities for which fair 
value is measured or disclosed in the 
consolidated financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, 
described as follows, based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole:
 
 
Level 1- Quoted (Unadjusted) marked 
prices in the active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities
 
 
Level 2- Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement is directly 
or indirectly observable
 
 
Level 3- Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement is unobservable.
 
 
For assets and liabilities that are recognised 
in the consolidated financial statements on 
a recurring basis, the Group determines 
whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing 
categorisation (based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
 
 
At each reporting date, the management 
analyses the movements in the values of 
assets and liabilities which are required 
to be re-measured or re-assessed as per 
the Group’s accounting policies. For this 
analysis, the management or its expert 
verifies the major inputs applied in the 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 362
Annual Report 
2023
339
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
latest valuation by agreeing the information 
in the valuation computation to contracts 
and other relevant documents.
 
 
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, 
the Group has determined classes of 
assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the 
asset or liability and the level of the fair 
value hierarchy as explained above.
	
d.	 Revenue recognition
 
 
Revenue is measured based on the 
consideration specified in a contract with a 
customer (transaction price) net of variable 
consideration e.g. discounts, volume 
rebates, any payments made to a customer 
(unless the payment is for a distinct good 
or service received from the customer) and 
excludes amounts collected on behalf of 
third parties. The Group recognises revenue 
when it transfers control over a product 
or service to a customer. Revenue is only 
recognised to the extent that it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal will not 
occur.
 
 
The Group provides incentives to its users 
in various forms including cashbacks. 
Incentives which are consideration payable 
to the customer that are not in exchange 
for a distinct good or service are generally 
recognized as a reduction of revenue.
 
 
Where the Group acts as an agent for selling 
goods or services, only the commission 
income is included within revenue. The 
specific revenue recognition criteria 
described below must also be met before 
revenue is recognized. Typically, the Group 
has a right to payment before or at the 
point that services are delivered. Cash 
received before the services are delivered 
is recognised as a contract liability. The 
amount of consideration does not contain a 
significant financing component as payment 
terms are less than one year. 
	
	
Sale of services 
 
 
Revenue from services is recognized 
when the control in services is transferred 
as per the terms of the agreement with 
customer i.e. as and when services are 
rendered. Revenues are disclosed net of 
the Goods and Services Tax charged on 
such services. In terms of the contract, 
excess of revenue over the billed at the 
year-end is carried in the balance sheet 
as trade receivables where the amount 
is recoverable from the customer without 
any future performance obligation and the 
Group has unconditional right over such 
consideration (i.e. if only the passage of 
time is required before payment of such 
consideration is due). Cash received before 
the services are delivered is recognised as 
a contract liability.
	
	
Commission
 
 
The Group facilitates recharge of talk time, 
bill payments, availability of bus tickets 
and sale of deal coupons and earns 
commission for the respective services. 
Commission income is recognized when 
the control in services is transferred to the 
customer when the services have been 
provided by the Group.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
	
	
Service fees from merchants
 
 
The Group earns service fee from 
merchants and recognizes such revenue 
when the control in services have been 
transferred by the Group i.e. as and when 
services have been provided by the Group. 
Such service fee is generally determined as 
a percentage of transaction value executed 
by the merchants. Amount received by the 
Group pending settlement are disclosed 
as payable to the merchants under other 
financial liabilities.
	
	
Revenue from broking activities
 
 
Revenue from broking activities, fees and 
delayed payment charges is recognized on 
the trade date of transaction (net of Goods 
& service tax (GST), securities transaction 
tax, stamp duties and other levies by SEBI 
and stock exchanges). Revenue from 
platform fees are received periodically 
but are recognized as earned on pro-rata 
basis over the term of the contract i.e. one 
year.
	
	
Government Grants
 
 
The Group recognises government grants 
only when there is reasonable assurance 
that the conditions attached to them will 
be complied with, and the grants will be 
received. Government grants related to 
revenue are recognized on a systematic 
basis in the Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss as other operating revenue 
over the periods necessary to match them 
with the related costs, if any, which they 
are intended to compensate.
	
	
Interest income
 
 
For all debt instruments measured either at 
amortised cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, interest income is 
recorded using the effective interest rate 
(EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts 
the estimated future cash payments or 
receipts over the expected life of the 
financial instrument or a shorter period, 
where appropriate, to the gross carrying 
amount of the financial asset or to the 
amortised cost of a financial liability. When 
calculating the effective interest rate, 
the Group estimates the expected cash 
flows by considering all the contractual 
terms of the financial instrument but does 
not consider the expected credit losses. 
Interest income is included in other income 
in the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss.
	
e.	 Trade receivable
 
 
Trade receivables are amounts due from 
customers for services performed in the 
ordinary course of business and reflects 
group’s unconditional right to consideration 
(that is, payment is due only on the 
passage of time). Trade receivables are 
recognised initially at the transaction price 
as they do not contain significant financing 
components. The group holds the trade 
receivables with the objective of collecting 
the contractual cash flows and therefore 
measures them subsequently at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, 
less loss allowance.

f.	 Taxes
	
	
Current income tax
 
 
Current income tax assets and liabilities 
are measured at the amount expected to 
be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws 
used to compute the amount are those that 
are enacted or substantively enacted, at 
the reporting date in the countries where 
the Group operates and generates taxable 
income.
 
 
Current income tax relating to items 
recognised outside consolidated statement 
of profit and loss is recognised either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity. Current 
tax items are recognised in correlation 
to the underlying transaction either in 
OCI or directly in equity. Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in 
the tax returns with respect to situations in 
which applicable tax regulations are subject 
to interpretation and considers whether it 
is probable that a taxation authority will 
accept an uncertain tax treatment. The 
Group measures its tax balances either 
based on the most likely amount or the 
expected value, depending on which 
method provides a better prediction of 
the resolution of the uncertainty.
	
	
Deferred tax
 
 
Deferred tax is provided using the liability 
method on temporary differences between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes at the reporting date. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences, except:
 
 
• When the deferred tax liability arises 
from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination 
and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit 
nor taxable profit or loss.
 
 
• In respect of taxable temporary 
differences 
associated 
with 
investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and interests in joint ventures, 
when the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for 
all deductible temporary differences, 
the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry 
forward of unused tax credits and unused 
tax losses can be utilised, The carrying 
amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred tax asset 
to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax 
assets are re-assessed at each reporting

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
date and are recognised to the extent that 
it has become probable that future taxable 
profits will allow the deferred tax asset to 
be recovered.
 
 
Deferred tax assets are not recognised 
for temporary differences between 
the carrying amount and tax bases of 
investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and interest in joint arrangements where 
it is not probable that the differences 
will reverse in the foreseeable future and 
taxable profit will not be available against 
which the temporary difference can be 
utilised.
 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the year when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at 
the reporting date.
 
 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised 
outside consolidated statement of profit 
and loss is recognised either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity. 
Deferred tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction 
either in OCI or directly in equity.
 
 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax 
liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable 
right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and the 
deferred taxes relate to the same taxable 
entity and the same taxation authority.
	
	
Taxes paid on acquisition of assets or 
on incurring expenses
 
 
Assets are recognised net of the amount 
of GST paid, except when the tax incurred 
on a purchase of assets is not recoverable 
from the taxation authority, in which case, 
the tax paid is recognised as part of the 
cost of acquisition of the asset.
 
 
Expenses are recognised net of the 
amount of GST paid, except when the tax 
incurred on a purchase of services is not 
recoverable from the taxation authority, in 
which case, the tax paid is expensed off 
in statement of profit and loss.
 
 
The net amount of tax recoverable from, 
or payable to, the taxation authority is 
included as part of other current/ non- 
current assets or other current liabilities 
in the consolidated balance sheet.
	
g.	 Non-current assets held for sale 
and discontinued operations
 
 
The Group classifies non-current assets 
and disposal groups as held for sale if 
their carrying amounts will be recovered 
principally through a sale rather than 
through continuing use. Actions required 
to complete the sale should indicate that 
it is unlikely that significant changes to the 
sale will be made or that the decision to 
sell will be withdrawn. Management must 
be committed to the sale expected within 
one year from the date of classification.

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 366
Annual Report 
2023
343
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
 
 
For these purposes, sale transactions 
include exchanges of non-current assets 
for other non-current assets when the 
exchange has commercial substance. The 
criteria for held for sale classification is 
regarded met only when the assets or 
disposal group is available for immediate 
sale in its present condition, subject only 
to terms that are usual and customary 
for sales of such assets (or disposal 
groups), its sale is highly probable; and it 
will genuinely be sold, not abandoned. The 
Group treats sale of the asset or disposal 
group to be highly probable when:
 
 
• The appropriate level of management 
is committed to a plan to sell the asset 
(or disposal group),
 
 
• An active programme to locate a 
buyer and complete the plan has been 
initiated (if applicable),
 
 
• The asset (or disposal group) is being 
actively marketed for sale at a price 
that is reasonable in relation to its 
current fair value,
 
 
• The sale is expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within 
one year from the date of classification 
, and
 
 
• Actions required to complete the plan 
indicate that it is unlikely that significant 
changes to the plan will be made or that 
the plan will be withdrawn.
 
 
Non-current assets held for sale and 
disposal groups are measured at the lower 
of their carrying amount and the fair value 
less costs to sell. Assets and liabilities 
classified as held for sale are presented 
separately in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet.
 
 
Property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets once classified as held 
for sale are not depreciated or amortised.
 
 
A disposal group qualifies as discontinued 
operation if it is a component of an entity 
that either has been disposed of, or is 
classified as held for sale, and:
 
 
• Represents a separate major line 
of business or geographical area of 
operations or
 
 
• Is part of a single co-ordinated plan 
to dispose of a separate major line 
of business or geographical area of 
operations.
 
 
Discontinued operations are excluded 
from the results of continuing operations 
and are presented as a single amount as 
profit or loss after tax from discontinued 
operations in the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss.
	
h.	 Property, plant and equipment
 
 
Property, plant and equipment are carried 
at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any accumulated impairment, if 
any. Property, plant and equipment is 
depreciated on a written down value basis 
to its residual value over its estimated 
useful life.
 
 
Cost directly attributable to acquisition are 
capitalised until the property, plant and 
equipment are ready for use, as intended 
by the management.  

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 367
Annual Report 
2023
344
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
 
 
Subsequent costs are capitalised on 
the carrying amount or recognised as a 
separate asset, as appropriate, only when 
future economic benefits associated 
with the item are probable to flow to 
the Group and cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. When significant parts 
of property, plant and equipment are 
required to be replaced at intervals, the 
Group depreciates them separately based 
on their specific useful lives. The carrying 
amount of any component accounted for 
as a separate asset is derecognised when 
replaced. All repair and maintenance are 
charged to consolidated statement of 
profit and loss during the reporting period 
in which they are incurred.
 
 
Advances paid towards the acquisition of 
property, plant and equipment outstanding 
at each balance sheet date is classified as 
capital advances under the non-current 
assets and the cost of assets not ready to 
use before such date are disclosed under 
‘Capital work in progress’.
 
 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and is 
recognised in the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss on the date of disposal 
or retirement.
 
 
Depreciation is provided using the written 
down value method except for plant and 
machinery on which straight line method 
is used, based on technical evaluation 
done by the management  and charged 
to consolidated statement of profit and 
loss as per the useful life prescribed under 
schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, 
given below:
Assets
Useful life

Servers and networking 
equipment (Computers)

(Computers)
3
Office equipment
5
Furniture and fittings
10
Vehicles
8
Plant & Machinery
- EDC/POS machines
3
- Soundbox
2
 
 
Leasehold improvements are depreciated 
over the shorter of their useful life or the 
lease term, unless the entity expects to 
use the assets beyond the lease term.
 
 
With effect from April 1, 2022, the Holding 
Company has changed the method of 
depreciation for Plant & Machinery from 
written down value method to straight 
line method along with change in life to 3 
years and 2 years for EDC/POS machines 
and Soundbox, respectively. The impact 
on account of above change in estimate 
is immaterial for the current and future 
periods.
 
 
The residual values, useful lives and 
methods of depreciation of property, 
plant and equipment are reviewed at 
each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.

i.	 Intangible assets
 
 
Separately acquired intangible assets, such 
as software are measured initially at cost. 
Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortization and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any. Costs associated with 
maintaining software programmes are 
recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Development costs that are directly 
attributable to the design and testing of 
identifiable and unique software products 
controlled by the Company are recognised 
as intangible assets where the following 
criteria are met:
 
 
• it is technically feasible to complete 
the software so that it will be available 
for use or sale
 
 
• management intends to complete the 
software and use or sell it
 
 
• there is an ability to use or sell the 
software
 
 
• it can be demonstrated how the 
software will generate probable future 
economic benefits
 
 
• adequate technical, financial and 
other resources to complete the 
development and to use or sell the 
software are available, and
 
 
• the expenditure attributable to the 
software during its development can 
be reliably measured.
 
 
Directly attributable costs that are 
capitalised as part of the software include 
employee costs.
	
	
Research and development costs
 
 
Research expenditure and development 
expenditure that do not meet the criteria 
above are recognised as an expense as 
incurred. Development costs previously 
recognised as an expense are not 
recognised as an asset in a subsequent 
period.
	
	
Amortization methods and periods
 
 
Amortization of intangible assets begins 
when development is complete and the 
asset is available for use. Software, licenses 
acquired and internally generated software 
are amortized at the rate of 40% per annum 
on written down value method. During the 
period of development, the asset is tested 
for impairment annually. The amortization 
period and the amortization method are 
reviewed at least at each financial year end. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the 
expected pattern of consumption of future 
economic benefits embodied in the asset 
are considered to modify the amortization 
period or method, as appropriate, and are 
treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
The amortization expense on intangible 
assets is recognized in the statement of 
profit and loss unless such expenditure 
forms part of carrying value of another 
asset.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
 
 
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition 
of an intangible asset are measured as 
the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and are recognized in the statement 
of profit and loss when the asset is 
derecognized.
	
j.	 Borrowing costs
 
 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to 
the acquisition, construction or production 
of an asset that necessarily takes a 
substantial period of time to get ready 
for its intended use or sale are capitalised 
as part of the cost of the asset. All other 
borrowing costs are expensed in the period 
in the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss in which they occur. Borrowing 
costs consist of interest and other costs 
that an entity incurs in connection with 
the borrowing of funds. 
	
k.	 Impairment of non-financial 
assets
 
 
For all non-financial assets, the Group 
assesses whether there are indicators of 
impairment. If such an indicator exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss, if any. Where the 
asset does not generate cash flows that 
are independent from other assets, the 
Group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which 
the asset belongs. 
 
 
The recoverable amount for an asset or 
CGU is the higher of its value in use and 
fair value less costs of disposal. If the 
recoverable amount of an asset or CGU 
is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount or CGU the asset is considered 
impaired and the carrying amount of the 
asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss. 
 
 
In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows of the asset or CGU are 
discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. In determining fair value less costs 
of disposal, recent market transactions are 
taken into account. If no such transactions 
can be identified, an appropriate valuation 
model is used. These calculations are 
corroborated by valuation multiples, 
quoted share prices for publicly traded 
companies or other available fair value 
indicators.
 
 
The Group bases its impairment calculation 
on detailed budgets and forecast 
calculations. These budgets and forecast 
calculations generally cover a period of 
five years. For longer periods, a long-term 
growth rate is calculated and applied to 
project future cash flows after the fifth 
year. To estimate cash flow projections 
beyond periods covered by the most 
recent budgets/forecasts, the Group 
extrapolates cash flow projections in 
the budget using a steady or declining 
growth rate for subsequent years, unless 
an increasing rate can be justified. In any 
case, this growth rate does not exceed 
the long-term average growth rate for 
the products, industries, or country or

2023

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
countries in which the entity operates, or 
for the market in which the asset is used.
 
 
An assessment is made at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is an 
indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or 
have decreased. If such indication 
exists, the Group estimates the asset’s 
or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously 
recognised impairment loss is reversed 
only if there has been a change in the 
assumptions used to determine the asset’s 
or CGU’s recoverable amount since the 
last impairment loss was recognised. The 
reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed 
its recoverable amount, nor exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had 
no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset in prior years. Such reversal is 
recognised in the consolidated statement 
of profit or loss. 
	
l.	 Provisions and contingencies
	
	
Provisions
 
 
Provisions are recognised when the 
Group has a present obligation (legal 
or constructive) as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation. When the 
Group expects some or all of a provision 
to be reimbursed, the reimbursement 
is recognised as a separate asset, but 
only when the reimbursement is virtually 
certain. The expense relating to a provision 
is presented in the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. 
If the effect of the time value of money 
is material, provisions are discounted 
using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, 
when appropriate, the risks specific to 
the liability. When discounting is used, 
the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a finance 
cost.
	
	
Contingencies
 
 
A contingent liability is a possible 
obligation that arises from past events 
whose existence will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or 
more uncertain future events beyond the 
control of the Group or a present obligation 
that is not recognized because it is not 
probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation. A 
contingent liability also arises in extremely 
rare cases where there is a liability that 
cannot be recognized because it cannot 
be measured reliably. The Group does not 
recognize a contingent liability but discloses 
its existence in the consolidated financial 
Statements.
 m.	 Retirement and other employee 
benefits
 
 
For defined benefit plans (gratuity), the 
liability or asset recognised in the balance 
sheet is the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the end of the reporting 
period less the fair value of plan assets. The 
defined benefit obligation is calculated by 
independent actuaries using the projected 
unit credit method. 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 371
Annual Report 
2023
348
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
 
 
The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows by 
reference to market yields at the end of 
the reporting period on government bonds 
that have terms approximating to the terms 
of the related obligation.
 
 
The net interest cost is calculated by 
applying the discount rate to the net 
balance of the defined benefit obligation 
and the fair value of plan assets. This cost 
is included in employee benefit expense in 
the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss.
 
 
Remeasurement gains and losses arising 
from experience adjustments and changes 
in actuarial assumptions are recognised 
in the period in which they occur, directly 
in other comprehensive income. They 
are included in retained earnings in the 
statement of changes in equity and in the 
balance sheet. Re-measurements are not 
reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent 
periods.
 
 
Changes in the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation resulting from 
plan amendments or curtailments are 
recognised immediately in profit or loss 
as past service cost.
 
 
The Group’s contributions to defined 
contribution plans (provident fund) 
are recognized in profit or loss when 
the employee renders related service. 
The Group has no further obligations 
under these plans beyond its periodic 
contributions.
 
 
The Group provides for liability at year end 
on account of un-availed earned leave and 
Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) as per 
actuarial valuation using projected unit 
credit method.
 
 
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including 
non-monetary benefits that are expected 
to be settled wholly within 12 months 
after the end of the period in which the 
employees render the related service 
are recognised in respect of employees’ 
services up to the end of the reporting 
period and are measured at the amounts 
expected to be paid when the liabilities 
are settled. The liabilities are presented 
as employee benefit payable under other 
financial liabilities in the consolidated 
balance sheet.
	
n.	 Share-based payments
	
	
i)	 Equity-settled transactions
 
 
 
Employees (including senior executives) 
of the Group receive remuneration in 
the form of share-based payments, 
whereby employees render services 
as consideration for equity instruments 
(equity-settled transactions).
 
 
 
The cost of equity-settled transactions 
is determined by the fair value at the 
date when the grant is made using an 
appropriate valuation model.
 
 
 
That cost is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in 
Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) 
reserves in equity, over the period in 
which the performance and/or service 

File: annual_report_23, Page number: 372

2023

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
conditions are fulfilled in employee 
benefits expense. The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date 
until the vesting date reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Group’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The consolidated 
statement of profit and loss expense 
or credit for a period represents the 
movement in cumulative expense 
recognised as at the beginning and 
end of that period and is recognised 
in employee benefits expense.
 
 
 
Performance conditions which are 
market conditions are taken into 
account when determining the 
grant date fair value of the awards. 
Service and non-market performance 
conditions are not taken into account 
when determining the grant date fair 
value of awards, but the likelihood of 
the conditions being met is assessed 
as part of the Group’s best estimate of 
the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest.
 
 
 
No expense is recognised for awards 
that do not ultimately vest because 
non-market performance and/or service 
conditions have not been met.
 
 
 
When the terms of an equity-settled 
award are modified, the minimum 
expense recognised is the expense 
had the terms not been modified, if 
the original terms of the award are met. 
An additional expense is recognised for 
any modification that increases the total 
fair value of the share-based payment 
transaction, or is otherwise beneficial 
to the employee as measured at the 
date of modification. 
 
 
 
Where an award is cancelled by the 
entity or by the counterparty, any 
remaining element of the fair value of 
the award is expensed immediately 
through profit or loss.
 
 
 
The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected as additional share 
dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
	
	
ii)	 Cash-settled transactions
 
 
 
For awards classified as cash settled 
share based transactions, the goods 
or services acquired are measured and 
the liability incurred, at the fair value of 
liability. Until the liability is settled, the 
fair value of the liability is re-measured 
at the end of each reporting period 
and at the date of settlement, with 
any changes in fair value recognised in 
consolidated statement of profit and 
loss for the period.
 
 
 
The cost of cash-settled transactions 
is determined by the fair value of equity 
instruments at each reporting date using 
an appropriate valuation model.
 
 
 
That cost is recognised, together with a 
corresponding increase in liability, over 
the period in which the performance 
and/or service conditions are fulfilled 
in employee benefits expense. The 
cumulative expense recognised for 
cash-settled transactions at each

Financial Statements
reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired and the 
Group’s best estimate of the number of 
equity instruments that will ultimately 
vest. The consolidated statement of 
profit and loss expense or credit for 
a period represents the movement in 
cumulative expense recognised as at 
the beginning and end of that period 
and is recognised in employee benefits 
expense.
 
 
 
No expense is recognised for awards 
that do not ultimately vest because 
non-market performance and/or service 
conditions have not been met.
 
 
 
The Group has set up Paytm Associate 
Benefit Welfare Trust (formerly known 
as One 97 Employee Welfare Trust) 
for administering certain types of 
share-based payment arrangements 
including awards given to employees 
of the outside group companies as 
well for awards of options of other 
companies given to its employees. The 
Group uses the Trust as a vehicle for 
distributing shares under the ESOP 
schemes. The Trust holds shares of the 
Group, for giving shares to employees. 
The Group treats the Trust as its 
extension and shares of the Group 
held by Trust are treated as treasury 
shares. Other assets held by the Trust 
are consolidated on a line-by-line basis 
with Group’s consolidated financial 
statements. Shares of other companies 
held by the Trust for distribution to its 
employees are separately disclosed 
under investments.
 
 
 
The Group has lost control over the 
Trust and accordingly, it is now not 
consolidated on a line-by-line basis 
with Group’s financial statements. 
	
o.	 Financial instruments
 
 
A financial instrument is any contract that 
gives rise to a financial asset of one entity 
and a financial liability or equity instrument 
of another entity.
	
	
Financial assets
 
 
Initial recognition and measurement
 
 
All financial assets are recognised initially 
at fair value plus, in the case of financial 
assets not recorded at fair value through 
profit or loss, transaction costs that are 
attributable to the acquisition of the 
financial asset. However, trade receivables 
that do not contain a significant financing 
component are measured at transaction 
price.
 
 
Subsequent measurement
 
 
For purposes of subsequent measurement, 
financial assets are classified in four 
categories:
 
 
• Debt instruments at amortized cost
 
 
• Debt instruments at fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
 
 
• Debt instruments, derivatives and 
equity instruments at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL)
 
 
• Equity instruments measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI)

Debt instruments at amortised cost
 
 
A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the 
amortised cost if both the following 
conditions are met:
 
 
a) The asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold 
assets for collecting contractual cash 
flows, and
 
 
b) Contractual terms of the asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal 
and interest (SPPI) on the principal 
amount outstanding.
 
 
After initial measurement, such financial 
assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised 
cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral 
part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is 
included in finance income in the profit or 
loss. The losses arising from impairment 
are recognised in the profit or loss. This 
category generally applies to trade and 
other receivables and is most relevant to 
the Group.
 
 
Debt instrument at FVTOCI
 
 
A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the 
FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are 
met:
 
 
a) The objective of the business model is 
achieved both by collecting contractual 
cash flows and selling the financial 
assets,   and
 
 
b) The asset’s contractual cash flows 
represent SPPI.
 
 
Debt instruments included within the 
FVTOCI category are measured initially as 
well as at each reporting date at fair value. 
Fair value movements are recognized in 
the other comprehensive income (OCI). 
However, the Group recognizes interest 
income, impairment losses and reversals 
and foreign exchange gain or loss in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss. 
On derecognition of the asset, cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in 
OCI is reclassified from the equity to 
consolidated statement of profit and loss. 
Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt 
instrument is reported as interest income 
using the EIR method.
 
 
Debt instrument at FVTPL
 
 
FVTPL is a residual category for debt 
instruments. Any debt instrument, 
which does not meet the criteria for 
categorization as at amortized cost or as 
FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
 
 
In addition, the Group may elect to 
designate a debt instrument, which 
otherwise meets amortized cost or 
FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, 
such election is allowed only if doing so 
reduces or eliminates a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency (referred to as 
‘accounting mismatch’). 
 
 
Debt instruments included within the FVTPL 
category are measured at fair value with 
all changes recognized in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss.

Equity investments
 
 
All equity investments in scope of Ind 
AS 109 are measured at fair value. The 
Group may make an irrevocable election 
to present in other comprehensive income 
subsequent changes in the fair value. 
The Group makes such election on an 
instrument-by-instrument basis. The 
classification is made on initial recognition 
and is irrevocable.
 
 
If the Group decides to classify an equity 
instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value 
changes on the instrument, excluding 
dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There 
is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to 
consolidated statement of profit or loss, 
even on sale of investment. However, the 
Group may transfer the cumulative gain or 
loss within equity.
 
 
Equity instruments included within the 
FVTPL category are measured at fair 
value with all changes recognized in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
 
 
The equity securities which are not held for 
trading, and for which the Group has made 
an irrevocable election at initial recognition 
to recognize changes in fair value through 
OCI rather than profit or loss as these 
are strategic investments and the Group 
considered this to be more relevant.
 
 
Equity investments in associates and 
joint ventures are measured at cost. The 
investments are reviewed at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment considering the 
provisions of Ind AS 36 ‘Impairment of 
Assets’. If any such indication exists, policy 
for impairment of non-financial assets is 
followed.
 
 
Derecognition
 
 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a 
part of a financial asset or part of a group 
of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised (i.e. removed from the 
Group’s consolidated balance sheet) when:
 
 
• The rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset have expired, or
 
 
• The Group has transferred its rights 
to receive cash flows from the asset 
or has assumed an obligation to pay 
the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party under 
a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and 
either (a) the Group has transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset, or (b) the Group has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, 
but has transferred control of the asset.
 
 
When the Group has transferred its rights 
to receive cash flows from an asset or has 
entered into a pass-through arrangement, 
it evaluates if and to what extent it 
has retained the risks and rewards of 
ownership. When it has neither transferred 
nor retained substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of the asset, nor transferred 
control of the asset, the Group continues 
to recognise the transferred asset to 
the extent of the Group’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Group also 
recognises an associated liability. The

Financial Statements
transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that 
the Group has retained.
 
 
Impairment of financial assets
 
 
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group 
applies expected credit loss (ECL) model 
for measurement and recognition of 
impairment loss on financial assets that 
are debt instruments, and are measured at 
amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, 
deposits, trade receivables and bank 
balance.
 
 
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance 
on trade receivables. The application 
of simplified approach does not require 
the Group to track changes in credit 
risk. Rather, it recognises impairment 
loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at 
each reporting date, right from its initial 
recognition. 
 
 
For recognition of impairment loss on other 
financial assets and risk exposure, the 
Group determines that whether there has 
been a significant increase in the credit 
risk since initial recognition. If credit risk 
has not increased significantly, 12-month 
expected credit loss (ECL) is used to 
provide for impairment loss. However, 
if credit risk has increased significantly, 
lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent 
period, credit quality of the instrument 
improves such that there is no longer a 
significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition, then the entity reverts 
to recognising impairment loss allowance 
based on 12-month ECL.
 
 
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit 
losses resulting from all possible default 
events over the expected life of a financial 
instrument. The 12-month ECL is a portion 
of the lifetime ECL which results from 
default events that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date.
 
 
ECL is the difference between all 
contractual cash flows that are due to the 
Group in accordance with the contract and 
all the cash flows that the entity expects to 
receive (i.e., all cash shortfalls), discounted 
at the original EIR.
 
 
The Group uses a provision matrix to 
determine impairment loss allowance 
on portfolio of its trade receivables. The 
provision matrix is based on its historically 
observed default rates over the expected 
life of the trade receivables and is adjusted 
for forward-looking estimates. At every 
reporting date, the historical observed 
default rates are updated and changes in 
the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
 
 
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) 
recognized during the period is recognized 
as income/ expense in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss. This amount 
is reflected under the head other expenses 
in the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss. For the financial assets measured 
as at amortised cost ECL is presented as 
an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of 
the measurement of those assets in the 
consolidated balance sheet. The allowance 
reduces the net carrying amount. Until the 
asset meets write-off criteria, the Group 
does not reduce impairment allowance 
from the gross carrying amount.

Financial liabilities
 
 
Initial recognition and measurement
 
 
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial 
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss, loans and 
borrowings, payables, or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in an 
effective hedge, as appropriate.
 
 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially 
at fair value and, in the case of loans and 
borrowings and payables, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs.
 
 
The Group’s financial liabilities include 
borrowings, lease liabilities, trade and 
other payables.
 
 
Subsequent measurement
 
 
The measurement of financial liabilities 
depends on their classification as 
described below: 
 
 
Loans and borrowings
 
 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the EIR 
method. Gains and losses are recognised 
in profit or loss when the liabilities are 
derecognised as well as through the EIR 
amortisation process. 
 
 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included as finance costs 
in the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss.
 
 
Derecognition
 
 
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged 
or cancelled or expires. When an existing 
financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially 
different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such 
an exchange or modification is treated as 
the derecognition of the original liability 
and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying 
amounts is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss.
 
 
Embedded derivatives
 
 
An embedded derivative is a component of 
a hybrid (combined) instrument that also 
includes a non-derivative host contract – with 
the effect that some of the cash flows of the 
combined instrument vary in a way similar 
to a stand-alone derivative. An embedded 
derivative causes some or all of the cash 
flows that otherwise would be required by 
the contract to be modified according to a 
specified interest rate, financial instrument 
price, commodity price, foreign exchange 
rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating 
or credit index, or other variable, provided 
in the case of a non-financial variable that 
the variable is not specific to a party to 
the contract.  Reassessment only occurs if 
there is either a change in the terms of the 
contract that significantly modifies the cash 
flows that would otherwise be required or 
a reclassification of a financial asset out of 
the fair value through profit or loss.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Financial Statements
 
 
If the hybrid contract contains a host that 
is a financial asset within the scope of 
Ind AS 109, the Group does not separate 
embedded derivatives. Rather, it applies 
the classification requirements contained 
in Ind AS 109 to the entire hybrid contract. 
Derivatives embedded in all other host 
contracts are accounted for as separate 
derivatives and recorded at fair value if 
their economic characteristics and risks 
are not closely related to those of the host 
contracts and the host contracts are not 
held for trading or designated at fair value 
though profit or loss. These embedded 
derivatives are measured at fair value with 
changes in fair value recognized in profit 
or loss, unless designated as effective 
hedging instruments.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is reported in 
the consolidated balance sheet if there is a 
currently enforceable legal right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	
p.	 Cash and cash equivalents
 
 
Cash and cash equivalent in the 
consolidated balance sheet comprise 
cash at banks and on hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less, which are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in value.
 
 
For the purpose of the consolidated 
statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and short-
term deposits, as defined above, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts as they are 
considered an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management.
	
q.	 Leases
	
	
The Group as a lessee
 
 
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily 
consist of leases for land and office 
premises. The Group assesses whether a 
contract contains a lease, at inception of a 
contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease 
if the contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period 
of time in exchange for consideration. To 
assess whether a contract conveys the 
right to control the use of an identified 
asset, the Group assesses whether: (i) the 
contact involves the use of an identified 
asset (ii) the Group has substantially all 
of the economic benefits from use of the 
asset through the period of the lease and 
(iii) the Group has the right to direct the 
use of the asset.
 
 
At the date of commencement of the lease, 
the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset 
(“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability 
for all lease arrangements in which it is a 
lessee, except for leases with a term of 
twelve months or less (short-term leases) 
and low value leases. For these short-term 
and low value leases, the Group recognizes 
the lease payments as an operating 
expense on a straight-line basis over the 
term of the lease.

Financial Statements
 
 
Certain lease arrangements includes the 
options to extend or terminate the lease 
before the end of the lease term. ROU 
assets and lease liabilities includes these 
options when it is reasonably certain that 
they will be exercised.
 
 
The right-of-use assets are initially 
recognized at cost, which comprises the 
initial amount of the lease liability adjusted 
for any lease payments made at or prior 
to the commencement date of the lease 
plus any initial direct costs less any lease 
incentives. They are subsequently measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any.
 
 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from 
the commencement date on a straight-line 
basis over the shorter of the lease term and 
useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-
use assets are evaluated for recoverability 
whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amounts may 
not be recoverable. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, the recoverable amount 
(i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to 
sell and the value-in-use) is determined on 
an individual asset basis unless the asset 
does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. 
In such cases, the recoverable amount is 
determined for the Cash Generating Unit 
(CGU) to which the asset belongs.
 
 
The lease liability is initially measured 
at amortized cost at the present value 
of the future lease payments. The 
lease payments are discounted using 
the interest rate implicit in the lease or, 
if not readily determinable, using the 
incremental borrowing rates in the country 
of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities 
are remeasured with a corresponding 
adjustment to the related right-of-use 
asset if the Group changes its assessment 
if whether it will exercise an extension or 
a termination option.
 
 
Lease liability and ROU asset have been 
separately presented in the consolidated 
balance sheet and lease payments have 
been classified as financing cash flows.
	
r.	 Earnings/ (loss) per share (EPS)
 
 
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by 
dividing the profit/ (loss) for the period 
attributable to equity holders by the 
weighted average number of Equity shares 
outstanding during the year excluding the 
treasury shares.
 
 
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by 
dividing the profit/ (loss) attributable to 
equity holders by the weighted average 
number of Equity shares outstanding 
during the period plus the weighted 
average number of Equity shares that 
would be issued on conversion of all the 
dilutive potential Equity shares into Equity 
shares.
	
s.	 Treasury shares
 
 
Own equity instruments that are reacquired 
(treasury shares) are recognised at cost 
and deducted from equity. No gain or 
loss is recognised in profit or loss on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of 
the Group’s own equity instruments. Any 
difference between the carrying amount 
and the consideration, if reissued, is 
recognised in other reserve.

t.	 Segment reporting
 
 
Operating segments are reported in a 
manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The Chief Operating 
decision-maker is responsible for allocating 
resources and assessing performance 
of the operating segments and makes 
strategic decisions.
	
u.	 Use of estimates
 
 
The Group is required to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, disclosure 
of contingent liabilities at the date of the 
consolidated financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenue and 
expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual results could differ from those 
estimates. The Group bases its estimates 
on historical experience and on various 
other assumptions that are believed to 
be reasonable, the results of which form 
the basis for making judgements about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities.
	
v.	 Exceptional Items
 
 
On certain occasions, the size, type or 
incidence of an item of income or expense, 
pertaining to the ordinary activities of the 
Group is such that its disclosure improves 
the understanding of the performance 
of the Group. Such income or expense 
is classified as an exceptional item and 
accordingly disclosed in the consolidated 
financial statements. Significant impact 
on the consolidated financial statements 
arising from impairment of goodwill, 
impairment of investments in associates 
and gain/ loss on disposal of subsidiaries 
and associates (other than major lines 
of business that meet the definition of a 
discontinued operation) are considered 
and reported as exceptional items.
	
w.	Contributed Equity
 
 
Equity shares are classified as equity.
 
 
The transaction costs of an equity 
transaction are accounted for as a 
deduction from equity (net of any related 
income tax benefit) to the extent they 
are incremental costs directly attributable 
to the equity transaction that otherwise 
would have been avoided. Qualifying 
transaction costs incurred in anticipation 
of an issuance of equity instruments is 
deferred on the balance sheet until the 
equity instrument is recognised. Deferred 
costs are subsequently reclassified as a 
deduction from equity when the equity 
instruments are recognised. If the equity 
instruments are not subsequently issued, 
the deferred transaction costs are charged 
off to profit or loss.
 
 
The transaction costs incurred with 
respect to the IPO of the Holding 
Company as reduced by the amount 
recovered from the selling shareholders 
are allocated between new issue of 
shares and listing of existing equity 
shares. The costs attributable to listing 
of existing shares is recognised in profit 
or loss and the costs attributable to 
new issuance of shares is recognised 
in equity.

# This amount is including cross charge of INR Nil (March 31, 2022: 2). Net depreciation charge 
of Right-of-use assets in profit & loss is INR 444 (March 31, 2022 INR 271).
 
The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Group 
becomes obliged to exercise (or not exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty is only 
revised if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs, which affects this 
assessment, and that is within the control of the lessee. The Group has given notice to vacate 
certain office premises. This has been accounted as lease termination. Hence, in accordance with 
Ind AS 116, Lease Liability has been re-measured by INR 9 (March 31, 2022: 9) with corresponding 
adjustment to Right-of-Use assets amounting to INR 24 (March 31, 2022: 6) and the remaining 
balance has been included in Miscellaneous Income disclosed under Other Income in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
 
The total cash outflow for leases for the year is INR 638 (March 31, 2022: 402)
	
Extension and termination options:
 
Extension and termination options are included in certain leases. These are used to maximise 
operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s operations. In certain 
cases, the extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by 
the respective lessor.

(iii) FVTOCI Reserve	 	
	
	
	
	 	
	
 
The Holding Company has elected to recognise changes in the fair values of the certain investments 
in equity instruments in other comprehensive income. These changes are accumulated within 
the FVTOCI reserve within equity. The Holding Company transfers amounts from this reserve to 
retained earning when relevant equity securities are derecognised.
(iv) Capital Redemption Reserve		 	
	
	
	
	
	
 
As per Companies Act, 2013, capital redemption reserve is created when company purchases 
its own shares out of free reserves or securities premium. A sum equal to the nominal value of 
the shares so purchased is transferred to capital redemption reserve. The reserve is utilised in 
accordance with the provisions of section 69 of the Companies Act, 2013.
(v) FCTR Reserve	 	
	
	
	
	
	 	
 
Exchange differences arising on translation of assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the 
Group’s foreign subsidiaries are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
separately in foreign currency translation reserve. The amounts recognised are transferred to 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss on disposal of the related foreign subsidiaries.

since the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for any of these obligations. 
However, based on past experience, the Group does not expect all employees to avail the full amount 
of accrued leave or require payment for such leave within the next 12 months. The amount not 
expected to be settled within next twelve months is INR 898 (March 31, 2022: INR 613).

20. Exceptional items
a) During previous year, the Group basis its assessment of future business projections of Orbgen 
Technologies Private Limited had recognized provision for impairment in the carrying value of 
its goodwill of INR 24. The impairment loss for Orbgen Technologies Private Limited was based 
on the equity value calculated based on cash flow projections with the business plan used for 
impairment testing using discounted cash flow method (Refer note 36).
21. Earnings per shares (EPS)
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of 
the parent by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent 
by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted 
average number of equity shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential 
equity shares into equity shares. 
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:

21. Earnings per shares (EPS) (Contd..)
* In view of losses during the current year and previous year, the options which are anti-dilutive 
have been ignored in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Accordingly, there is no variation 
between basic and diluted earnings per share.
# Pursuant to the approval of the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Holding Company 
held on June 30, 2021, each equity share of face value of INR 10 per share was sub-divided into ten 
equity shares of face value of INR 1 per share, with effect from record date, i.e., June 30, 2021.
22. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, 
assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next 12 months, are described below.
Deferred taxes and Income taxes
Deferred tax assets can be recognised for deductible temporary differences (including unused tax 
losses) only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary difference can be utilized. Most of the companies forming part of the Group are 
yet to generate operating profits, Management has assessed that as at March 31, 2023 it is not probable 
that such deferred tax assets can be realised in excess of available taxable temporary differences. 
Management re-assesses unrecognized deferred tax assets at each reporting date and recognizes 
to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset 
to be recovered. For details about deferred tax assets, refer note 28.
During FY 2019-20 (AY 2020-21) a shareholder of the Holding Company holding 30.33% of shares 
of the Holding Company had transferred its shareholding to its group company (both entities being 
100% subsidiaries of the same ultimate parent entity). Based on advice from the Holding Company’s 
tax experts, Management has assessed that a mere change in shareholding within the same group will

not be an affirmative position to say that the shareholding has been changed. Further, since the shares 
of the Holding Company carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power were beneficially 
held by persons, i.e. ultimate holding company of the aforesaid entities, who beneficially held shares 
of the Holding Company carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power on the last day 
of the year or years in which the loss was incurred, the Holding Company shall be entitled to carry 
forward and set off these losses against the taxable income of future years in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 79 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. (refer note 28)
Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits) 
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are 
determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that 
may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount 
rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and 
its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. 
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated , the management considers the 
interest rates of government bonds. The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. 
The mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary 
increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation rates. For further details about 
gratuity obligations, refer note 27.
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance 
sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured 
using valuation techniques including the DCF model, Price of Recent Investment (PORI) method and 
Comparable Company Multiples (CCM) method. The inputs to these models are taken from observable 
markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing 
fair values. For further details about Fair value measurement, refer note 31.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit risks associated with its assets 
carried at amortized cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been 
a significant increase in credit risk. Note 32 details how the Group determines whether there has been 
a significant increase in credit risk.
Impairment reviews
Goodwill is tested for impairment at-least on an annual basis or when events that occur / changes 
in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying value. In

(Contd..)
calculating the value in use, the Group is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
inter-alia concerning the growth in EBITDA, long-term growth rates; discount rates to reflect the risks 
involved. Also, judgement is involved in determining the CGU for allocation of the goodwill.  For details 
about impairment reviews, refer note 36.
Incentives
The Group provide incentives to users in various forms including cashbacks to promote its platform. 
Incentives to  users to whom the Group has a performance obligation is recorded as a reduction of 
revenue to the extent of the revenue earned. For the incentives to other transacting users to whom the 
Group has no performance obligation, management is required to determine whether the incentives are 
in substance a payment on behalf of the merchants and should therefore be recorded as a reduction of 
revenue or as marketing and promotional expenses. Some of the factors considered in management’s 
evaluation of such incentives being payments on behalf of  merchants include whether the incentives 
are given at the Group’s discretion, contractual agreements with the merchants, business strategy and 
objectives and design of the incentive program(s), etc.

# The net worth of First Games Technology Private Limited (formerly known as Paytm First Games 
Private Limited), a joint venture of the Group, has been fully eroded with net current liabilities. 
The carrying value of the share of investment in the consolidated financial statements is reduced 
to 'Nil' as the group is not liable to contribute in excess of their contribution.
 
The management has concluded that the Group doesn’t control First Games Technology Private 
Limited (formerly known as Paytm First Games Private Limited) even if it holds more than half 
of the voting rights of the investee entity. As per management’s judgement and evaluation,  the 
Group doesn’t have unilateral ability to direct the relevant activities.  The Group and other investor 
has ability to jointly direct the relevant activities of the investee entity by virtue of shareholder’s 
agreement and hence considered to be a joint venture.

Notes:
 
 
1. Weighted average share price is based on the value of Equity Shares arrived at by using 
Discounted Cash Flow Method, OPM Method or Backsolve method and share prices based 
on secondary transactions, where available.
 
 
2. Dividend yield is considered zero, as no dividend payout is expected in the foreseeable future.
 
 
3. Risk free return is based on the yield to maturity of Indian treasury securities, with a 
maturity corresponding to the expected term of ESOP.
 
 
4. Annualized volatility is based on the median weekly volatility of selected comparable 
companies for a time period commensurate with the expected term.

27. Gratuity
The Group provides for gratuity for employees in India as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. 
Employees who are in continuous service for a period of 5 years are eligible for gratuity. The amount 
of gratuity payable on retirement/termination is the employees last drawn basic salary per month 
computed proportionately for 15 days salary multiplied for the number of years of service upto a limit 
of INR 20 Lakhs. The gratuity plan is a funded plan and the Holding company makes contributions 
to recognised fund/insurer in India. The Group does not fully fund the liability and maintains a target 
level of funding to be maintained over a period of time based on estimations of expected gratuity 
payments. Disclosures given below are as per actuarial valuation report of independent actuary.
The following tables summarize the components of net benefit expenses recognized in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss and the funded status and amount recognized in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.

The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates 
the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions 
occurring at the end of the reporting period. The methods and types of assumptions used in 
preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior year. 
 
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the period ending March 31, 2024 
are INR 254 (March 31, 2023 - INR 162).
 
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 2.79 years (March 31, 2022- 
2.78 years).   
 
 
 
 
The average remaining working life of members of the defined benefit obligation as at March 31, 
2023 is 30.87 years (as at March 31, 2022- 29.91 years)
 
The expected maturity analysis of  gratuity is as follows:

Risk exposure
 
Through its defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant 
of which are detailed below:
	
Asset volatility: The plan assets are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond 
yields. If plan assets underperform this yield, there will be a deficit of the plan asset investments 
in fixed income securities with high grades and in government securities. These are subject to 
interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk to an acceptable level.
	
Changes in bond yields: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based 
on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
	
Inflation risks: The payments are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
	
Life expectancy: Obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in 
life expectancy and inflation will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. This is particularly 
significant where inflationary conditions result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.

ii) The Group will continue to assess the impact of further developments relating to retrospective 
application of Supreme Court judgement dated February 28, 2019 clarifying the definition 
of 'basic wages' under Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1952 
and deal with it accordingly. In the assessment of the management, the aforesaid matter is 
not likely to have a significant impact and accordingly, no provision has been made in these 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
iii) The Holding Company has been made aware of certain matters/claims relating to infringement 
of trademarks and patents in relation to the business activities carried on by it. The Holding 
Company actively monitors such matters/claims along with appropriate legal/technology 
experts to assess their veracity and takes action as considered necessary. In the opinion 
of the management, no material liability is likely to arise on account of such matters/claims, 
based on assessments made to date.
 
 
Notes:	
 
 
1) It is not practicable for the Group to estimate the timing of cash outflows, if any.
 
 
2) The Group does not expect any reimbursements in respect of the above contingent liabilities.

30. Buyback of shares
The Board of Directors of the Holding Company at its meeting held on December 13, 2022 had 
approved buy-back of equity shares amounting to INR 8,500 (Maximum buy-back size, excluding 
transaction costs and tax on buy-back) at a price not exceeding INR 810 per equity share (Maximum 
buy-back price). The buy-back was offered to the equity shareholders of the Company under the 
open market route through the stock exchanges.
The buyback of equity shares commenced on December 21, 2022 and was completed on February 13, 
2023. During this period, the Holding Company had bought back 15,566,746 Equity Shares at an average 
price of INR 545.93 per Equity Share aggregating to INR 8,498 (99.98% of the Maximum Buyback Size) 
and subsequently these shares have been extinguished.
Consequent to the said buy-back, the equity share capital has been reduced by INR 16 and an equivalent 
amount has been transferred from securities premium account to capital redemption reserve. Further INR 
10,545 has been debited to the securities premium account on account of premium on shares bought 
back, related transaction costs and related taxes.
31. Fair value
Fair value hierarchy
The following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the group’s assets and liabilities:
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset 
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).

The Group has assessed that fair value of all other financial assets and liabilities including cash and 
cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans, 
other financial assets, trade payables, lease liabilities, borrowings and other financial liabilities, 
approximate their carrying amounts.
32. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and 
liquidity risk. The Group continues to focus on a system-based approach to business risk management. 
The Group’s financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and 
effective management of key risks facing the business. Backed by strong internal control systems, 
the current Risk Management Framework rests on policies and procedures issued by appropriate 
authorities; process of regular internal reviews/audits to set appropriate risk limits and controls; 
monitoring of such risks and compliance confirmation for the same.

32. Financial risk management objectives and policies (Contd..)
a.	 Market Risk
 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market prices. Market prices comprise three types of risk: interest rate risk, 
foreign currency risk and price risk. The Group has in place appropriate risk management policies 
to limit the impact of these risks on its financial performance. The Group ensures optimization of 
cash through fund planning and robust cash management practices.
	
(i)	Interest Rate Risk
 
 
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument 
will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. 
 
 
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the 
Group’s borrowings with floating interest rates.
 
 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest 
rates, being a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rate, with all other variables held constant, 
of the Group’s loss before tax due to the impact on floating rate borrowings.
As at
March 31, 2023 
March 31, 2022 
Effect on loss before tax:
Decrease by 50 bps
(*)
(*)
Increase by 50 bps
*
*
 
 
Other financial assets and liabilities of the Group are either non-interest bearing or fixed 
interest bearing instruments, the Group’s net exposure to interest risk on such instruments is 
negligible.
 
 
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a reasonably possible change in the under-lying 
interest rate of the Group’s borrowings while assuming all other variables to be constant.
 
 
Based on the movements in the interest rates historically and the prevailing market conditions 
as at the reporting date, the Group’s management has concluded that the above mentioned 
rates used for sensitivity are reasonable benchmarks.

Financial Statements
	
(ii) Price risk
	
	
The Group invests its surplus funds in debt based mutual fund, fixed deposits, Commercial 
papers, Treasury bills and Government Securities. As on March 31, 2023, mutual fund investments 
were in debt based funds only.
 
 
Mutual fund investments are susceptible to market price risk, mainly arising from changes in 
the interest rates or market yields which may impact the return and value of such investments. 
 
 
Set out below is the impact of a 0.25% movement in the NAV of mutual funds and debt 
instruments on the Group’s loss before tax:

The Group is also exposed to equity/ preference shares price risk arising from investments 
held by the Group and classified in the balance sheet either as fair value through OCI or at 
fair value through profit or loss (refer note 6(a) and 6(b)). To manage its price risk arising from 
investments in equity/preference shares, the Group diversifies its portfolio. Diversification of 
the portfolio is done in accordance with the limits set by the Group.
	
(iii) Foreign currency risk
 
 
The Indian Rupee is the Group’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the Group’s 
results are presented in Indian Rupee and exposures are managed against Indian Rupee 
accordingly. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an 
exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure 
to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s operating 
activities and investing activities (when revenue, expense and Property, Plant and Equipment 
is denominated in a foreign currency).
 
 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities denominated in United 
States Dollar (USD) are as follows:

The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity of profit or loss to a reasonably possible 
change in USD exchange rates, with all other variables held constant. The Group’s exposure 
to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.
 
 
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a reasonably possible change in the under-lying 
foreign currency against the functional currency while assuming all other variables to be 
constant.
 
 
Based on the movements in the foreign exchange rates historically and the prevailing market 
conditions as at the reporting date, the Group’s management has concluded that the above 
mentioned rates used for sensitivity are reasonable benchmarks.
 
 
*Amount below rounding off norms adopted by the Group
b.	 Credit Risk
 
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument 
or contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating 
activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its investing activities, including deposits with 
banks. Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an 
ongoing basis. The Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model on financial assets measured 
at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank balance. Cash 
and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirement of Ind AS 109, the identified 
impairment loss was immaterial.
 
All of the Group investments and loans at amortised cost are considered to have low credit risk, 
and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 months expected 
losses. Management considers instruments to be low credit risk when they have a low risk of 
default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the 
near term.

(i)	Trade receivables
 
 
The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers. Customer 
credit risk is managed subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control 
relating to customer credit risk management. An impairment analysis is performed at each 
reporting date by grouping the receivables in homogeneous group. The calculation is based 
on lifetime expected credit losses.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of trade 
receivables. The Group does not hold collateral as security.
	
(ii) Other investments (excluding loans to related parties)
 
 
All of the Group’s other investments (preference shares, government securities, commercial 
papers, treasury bills and security deposits) at amortised cost are considered to have low 
credit risk, and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 
months’ expected losses. Management consider ‘low credit risk’ for listed instruments to be 
an investment grade credit rating with at least one major rating agency. Other instruments 
are considered to have low credit risk when they have a low risk of default and the issuer has 
a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.
	
(iii) Loan to related parties
 
 
The group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of loan and whether 
there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each 
reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the group 
compares the risk of a default occurring on the loan as at the reporting date with the risk of 
default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and supportive 
forwarding-looking information.
	
(iv) Other financial assets
 
 
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s 
treasury department in accordance with the Group’s policy. Investment of surplus funds is 
made only with banks of high repute.

c.	 Liquidity Risk
 
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through 
the use of bank overdrafts, working capital loans etc. Group monitor their risk of shortage of 
funds using cash flow forecasting models. These models consider the maturity of their financial 
investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations.
 
The Group’s objective is to provide financial resources to meet its business objectives in a timely, 
cost effective and reliable manner. A balance between continuity of funding and flexibility is 
maintained through the use of bank borrowings. The Group also monitors compliance with its 
debt covenants. The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual

33. Capital Management
The Group’s objectives while managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern 
and to generate adequate returns for its shareholders and ensuring benefits for other stakeholders. The 
key objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure 
with the focus on total equity, uphold investor; creditor and customer confidence, and ensure future 
development of its business activities. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments 
to it, in light of changes in economic conditions or its business requirements.
The Group's capital management objective is to remain majorly a debt-free Group till the time it achieves 
break-even. In order to meet this objective, Group meets anticipated funding requirements for developing 
new businesses, expanding its geographical base, entering in to strategic mergers and acquisitions and 
other strategic investments, by issuance of equity capital together with cash generated from Group’s 
operating and investing activities. The Group utilizes certain working capital facilities in the form of short 
term bank overdraft to meet anticipated interim working capital requirements.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the year 
ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.
34. Segment Reporting
The Group is engaged in different business units, including payment and financial services, commerce 
and cloud services and the Board of Directors (Chief Operating Decision Maker “CODM”) reviews 
the information at the revenue level and does not allocate operating costs and expenses, assets and 
liabilities across business units, as the CODM does not use such information to allocate resources or 
evaluate the performance of the business units. Allocation of resources and assessment of financial 
performance is done at the consolidated level. The way the CODM reviews the performance, 
management of the Company has concluded that it constitutes a single segment as per Ind AS 108 
‘Operating Segments’. Hence, no separate disclosure is required for segments.
The Group has revenues primarily from customers domiciled in India. Substantially all of the Group’s 
non-current operating assets are domiciled in India.
Information about major customers
Revenues of INR 8,590 are derived from one external customer (March 31, 2022: INR 10,107 from 
one external customer).

36. Impairment review of goodwill arising on Consolidation
The Group monitors the business of the respective acquisitions independently and thus considers 
each acquisition as a separate Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’).

The Group reviews the goodwill for any impairment at the CGU level. The recoverable amount of the 
above CGUs are based on value-in-use, which is determined based on five year business plans that 
have been approved by the management for internal purposes. The said planning horizon of five years 
reflects the assumptions for short to medium-term market developments. The cash flows beyond 
the planning period are extrapolated using appropriate terminal growth rates. The terminal growth 
rates used do not exceed the long term average growth rates of the respective industry and country 
in which the entity operates and are consistent with the internal/external sources of information.
The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations are as follows: 
• Earnings before interest and taxes margins (‘EBIT’) 
• Discount rate
• Growth rates
EBIT margins: The margins have been estimated based on past experience after considering incremental 
revenue arising out of increase in payment business from the existing and new customers. Margins 
will be positively impacted from the efficiencies and initiatives driven by the Group; whereas, factors 
like increased cost of operations may impact the margins negatively. 
Discount rate: Discount rate reflects the current market assessment of the risks specific to the CGU 
estimated based on the weighted average cost of capital. Pre-tax discount rate used ranged from 
20% to 25% (March 31, 2022: 20% to 25%) which in the opinion of management are consistent with 
companies in similar business.
Growth rates: The terminal growth rates used are in the opinion of management in line with the long-
term average growth rates of the respective industry in which the entity operates and are consistent 
with the internal/external sources of information. The terminal growth rates used in extrapolating

aggregating to INR 374 outstanding beyond the stipulated time period permitted under the RBI 
Master Direction on Export of Goods and Services vide FED Master Direction No. 16/2015-16 dated 
January 1, 2016 (as amended), issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The Holding Company had

approval has been received. Further, two subsidiaries namely Mobiquest Mobile Technologies Private 
Limited and Orbgen Technologies Private Limited, had applied to AD Bank/ RBI for extension and 
write-off of receivables aggregating to INR 6. Based on response from AD Bank/RBI, these companies 
have obtained the STPI registration and are in the process of filing their respective applications for

42. Notes given by the subsidiary and associate in their respective 
Financial Statements/Information:
a) Paytm Payments Services Limited (Subsidiary):
 
"The Company filed an application for authorization to set up Payment System (‘PA application’) 
under sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 with the 
Department of Payment and Settlement Systems, Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) on January 8, 
2021, in response to which, the Company received a letter from the RBI on November 25, 2022. 
As per the letter, the Company was required to obtain necessary approval for past downward 
investment from its parent company, One 97 Communications Limited ("OCL"), in compliance 
with Foreign Direct Investment (“FDI”) Guidelines and resubmit the PA application within 120 
calendar days. Pursuant to the aforesaid, the Company had applied to the requisite government 
authorities seeking approval for the past downward investment made by OCL on December 14, 
2022, which is still under process.
 
Further, the Company has received an extension of time from RBI, vide its letter dated March 23, 
2023, for resubmission of the application. As per RBI's letter, the Company can continue with the 
online payment aggregation business, while it awaits approval from Government of India (‘GoI’) for 
past downward investment from OCL into the Company and needs to resubmit the PA application 
within 15 days of receipt of the approval from GoI and to inform RBI immediately, if any adverse 
decision is taken by the GoI.
 
The RBI has directed the Company not to onboard new merchants. Management has assessed 
that this does not have a material impact on our business and revenues since the communication 
from RBI is applicable only to onboarding of new merchants."

b) Paytm Payments Bank Limited (Associate):
 
"During FY2022, pursuant to a supervisory process, RBI directed the Bank to stop the onboarding 
of new customer’s w.e.f. March 11, 2022. During FY2023, RBI appointed an external auditor for 
conducting a comprehensive systems audit of the Bank. On October 21, 2022 the Bank received 
the final report thereof from RBI outlining the need for continued strengthening of IT outsourcing 
processes and operational risk management, including KYC/AML at the Bank. Pursuant to a 
supervisory engagement thereafter, RBI recommended remediating action steps (including further 
steps to be taken by the Bank) in a time bound manner. The Bank has completed the compliance 
to these instructions of RBI and the same is currently being validated by RBI."

e-voting and e-voting at AGM to its Members in respect 
of the businesses to be transacted at the AGM. For this 
purpose, the Company has appointed Link Intime India

Letter to 
Shareholders
Dear Shareholders,
It gives me great pleasure to present Paytm’s annual report for  
FY 2021-22, our first as a publicly listed company. I am proud of what 
Paytm has achieved in the last year with rapid growth in payments, 
and a huge scale-up in lending and payments devices businesses. 
We remain committed to building a large, profitable company and 
creating long-term shareholder value.
India is in the midst of a technology revolution, as consumers and small businesses are 
adopting technology at a rapid pace. The network effect of this adoption across use 
cases is visible and is having a profound impact. Payments has been at the forefront 
of this revolution and now consumers and merchants are increasingly using, and 
indeed demanding, digital financial services. We are proud to say that our businesses 
are leveraging this opportunity and contributing in further accelerating the pace of 
technology adoption. I believe, in the days to come, India will become an exemplar 
market, especially in payments, leading to financial services.
The core of Paytm’s business model is to acquire consumers and merchants for 
payments services, and upselling them financial services, by leveraging our distribution, 
collections and our transactional and behavioural insights. We have sharpened our 
focus on Payments and distribution of Lending products and have prioritised these 
businesses in our resource allocation.
Paytm app now has more and more users coming on to our platform for their everyday 
usage without requiring any incentive from us. We are focused on further expanding 
our payments network by acquiring quality customers and merchants with high activity 
rate and transaction frequency. UPI has emerged as one of the key customers and 
merchant acquisition channels for us. UPI merchant payments, which are free for the 
merchant, have now also become economically viable because the government is 
encouraging digital payments through incentives on UPI P2M transactions. We have 
been able to monetise our platform by upselling financial services to our customers 
and merchants, and also upselling payment devices to our merchants.
Our team is focused on expanding the payments offerings available to our consumers 
- on Paytm app, in-store, online, using FASTag affixed on cars, among many other 
everyday habits. Our focus is also on showing how creditors can leverage this mobile 
payments relationship for lending. BNPL, which allows our partner financial institutions 

File: annual_report_22, Page number: 26

Annual Report 
2022
to issue credit to consumers at the point of sale, has become a consumer favourite. 
Our attention is on helping our financial institution partners issue less and less risky 
loans to more and more people. Aligned to the Government and Regulator expectations 
of expanding financial services inclusion and digital disbursement of lending, Paytm’s 
business model expands the creditworthiness of consumers and enables greater access. 
We see that merchants intuitively understand the value of digital payments; and 
increasingly, they are ready to pay for technology that makes digital payments 
easier and trusted. We are increasingly seeing merchants opt for devices, whether 
Paytm card machines or Soundbox, on their counter, and this adoption of devices 
by merchants is almost certainly going to further accelerate. Once merchants start 
accepting payments through us, they start to become eligible for lending from the 
lenders that we have partnered with, who are able to rely on our distribution and 
merchant insights, otherwise unavailable to them. This presents us with a great 
opportunity to enable financial inclusion for a large number of merchants. This journey 
means that the relationship we have with our merchants expands over time from QR 
payments to devices to credit.
Paytm pioneered mobile payments in India, serving customers as well as small and 
large merchants. Paytm’s technology platform is focused on delivering newer ways for 
payment solutions, including GPS based payment etc. Our offering to the ecosystem is 
innovative technology and the ultimate business solution that has become mainstream 
for the industry and the country. We strive to continue delivering innovative funding 
sources and payment methods, which is also encouraged by Regulators.
I believe that over the past year, our team has done a great job in massively 
improving our revenues and contribution profits, which allows for investments in 
our payments and credit businesses while at the same time reducing our EBITDA 
losses. We are seeing excellent momentum in our businesses and are on track to 
achieve operating profitability (EBITDA before ESOP cost) by the quarter ending 
September 2023. 
Yours sincerely,
Vijay

Macroeconomic overview
India is a country with hundreds of millions of consumers who are fast adopting smartphones, and 
aspiring to a world class experience in payments and financial services. Similarly, there are millions of 
small businesses who would benefit from having increased access to affordable software, technology 
and financial services. We believe these consumers and small businesses can be served through 
world-class, technology-led, digital-first payment and financial services.
Despite the impact due to COVID-19 pandemic on global economies, India continues to be the fastest 
growing major economy globally and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9% over next five years, 
according to RedSeer. The key aspects of economic growth in India are (i) rising consumption, (ii) 
favourable demographics with a large working population, and (iii) growing urbanization.
Industry overview and Outlook 
India’s payment landscape has transformed over the last decade driven by the innovations in mobile 
payments and payments infrastructure, the government’s vision to transform India into a cashless 
society, high consumer and merchant acceptance, and regulatory support. Digital payments continue 
to scale rapidly due to the increasing user preference of transacting through their mobile phones for 
bill payments, in-store payments and for money-transfer, combined with growth of digital commerce 
and services. As a result of these factors, unique online transacting users, transacting for services 
such as online banking, mobile top-ups, in-store payments etc. are expected to grow from 250-300 
million in FY 2021 to 700-750 million by FY 2026 (Source: The Digital Transformation of Payments and 
Financial Services in India dated October 23, 2021, prepared by RedSeer).
We provide payment services to consumers and merchants, allow merchants to grow their business 
using Paytm’s consumer traffic, and provide financial services, particularly lending (through our 
financial institution partners) to both consumers and merchants. In these areas, India has lower 
levels of online penetration vs other markets. Compared to other countries, India’s value of card 
transactions (credit card + debit card) as a % of GDP, at 7% in CY21E, is one of the lowest. Including 
mobile payments, this ratio is 14%, still lower than just card payment transactions in other countries 
(Source: broker research). Over the next 8 years, broker research expects digital payments’ share in 
GDP to more than double to 32%, similar to current card payment penetration levels in countries such 
as the UK and the US, but still lower than penetration levels in China and South Korea.
As per estimates from brokers, most of Paytm's TAMs are expected to grow at 20%+ CAGR over the 
next 5 years. Broker research estimates the digital payments TAM in India to be US$436 billion in 
FY22E (merchant payments only; cards + UPI), having grown at a 38% CAGR since FY17. They forecast 
India's digital payments TAM to grow at a 23% FY22E-30E CAGR to reach US$2.3 tn by FY30E. 
By FY 2026, retail lending is expected to be a US$1 trillion market, and MSME lending is expected to 
be a US$600 billion market (Source: RedSeer). Across such traditional financial services products, 
India has growth opportunities aided by technology and rising digitization to increase access and 
reach. Industry research estimates that the total BNPL market in India stood at US$3 billion in FY21, 
of which US$2 billion was through online channels, while remaining US$1 billion was through offline 
channels. They forecast the BNPL industry to grow at 65% FY21-26E CAGR to reach US$35 billion 
(14% of credit spends) by FY26E. Of the US$35 billion, they estimate online channels to constitute 
US$24 billion and the remainder US$11 billion from offline medium.
Our Business Model
Our business is to offer a comprehensive suite of payments services to acquire consumers and merchants, 
as well as leverage our two-sided, consumer and merchant ecosystem and rich insights from our platform 
to cross-sell high-margin financial services and merchant services (commerce and cloud).

Consumers come to our platform for a variety of payment use cases as well as the comprehensiveness 
of available payment instruments. High consumer adoption encourages merchants to join our platform, 
and also use our commerce offerings to leverage our consumer traffic to grow their business. At the 
same time, more merchants on our platform leads to a more diverse array of use cases on offer for 
consumers. This creates a self-reinforcing loop, which demonstrates high frequency, high repeat 
rates, and leads to powerful consumer stickiness and retention.
Our large distribution, and insights from our payment and commerce services, enables us to upsell 
high margin and low CAC financial services to our consumers and merchants. For consumers and 
merchants, we offer various lending products, with our financial institution partners, such as Paytm 
Postpaid (BNPL), Personal Loans and Merchant Loans.
Payment Services
On our platform, consumers can use a wide selection of instruments, both third party like cards, net 
banking and Paytm Payment Instruments like Wallet, Paytm Postpaid (BNPL) to make online payments 
for Mobile Recharge, Utility Bills, Rent, Education, Wallet top-ups and money transfers using the 
Paytm app. Consumers can also make online payments on third party apps and in-store payments 
through QR codes and devices. 
The increased adoption of payments use-cases on our platform has resulted in our Monthly 
Transacting Users (MTU) growing 41% Y-o-Y to surpass 70 million during Q4 FY 2022.

On the merchant side of our platform, we help our partners grow their businesses by providing 
solutions that allow them to accept payments through a wide variety of instruments and by deploying 
devices that help with reconciliations.
Entry level merchants can use a free Mobile QR to accept payments, typically using Paytm Payment 
Instruments or UPI. Government incentives on UPI person-to-merchant (“P2M”) payments have created 
a multiplier effect - the offering is free for merchants and hence encourages high usage, whereas it 
is economically viable for payment providers such as Paytm because of government incentives, and 
upsell opportunities. Small retailers can upgrade to Soundbox devices which allow better reconciliation 
for merchants, hence enhancing their trust in digital payments, and generating subscription revenues 
for us. Our mid-sized and large retailers also use our POS devices which enables them to accept 
mobile and card payments, thus generating both MDR as well as subscription revenues for us. For 
Online and Omni channel merchants we offer a robust payment gateway product allowing merchants 
to reliably accept payments across all channels, thus generating MDR revenue and platform fees.
As of March 2022, our merchant base has grown to 26.7 million, with deployed payment devices 
increasing to 2.9 million from 0.8 million in FY 2021, thus accelerating our subscription revenues.

customer’s KYC, credit bureau reporting. We work with our financial institution partners in improving 
their distribution, underwriting and collections, and aim to drive the increase of credit access in India.

Merchant (Commerce and Cloud) Services
To help our merchant partners grow their business by leveraging Paytm’s consumer traffic, we offer 
them merchant services like ability to sell tickets to customers, advertising, loyalty solutions like deals 
and gift vouchers. We also provide software and cloud services to enterprises, telecom companies, 
and digital and fintech platforms to track and enhance customer engagement, build payment systems, 
and unlock customer insights.
Our commerce offerings provide a lifestyle destination for consumers to avail services such as travel 
and entertainment ticketing, gaming and more. Easy access to such services within the Paytm App 
environment plays an important role in user engagement and retention.
Business Update and Outlook
We ended the fiscal year with strong growth across our businesses and reductions in EBITDA losses (before 
ESOP cost) which puts us well on track to achieve operating profitability by the quarter ending September 
2023. Our platform growth continues to be impressive, represented by our average Monthly Transacting 
Users (MTU) and registered merchant base. We have also seen increased monetization of payments, in 
the form of both MDR and subscription revenues. Our platform presents immense opportunities to our 
merchants to attract customers at a large scale, and we leverage our distribution network to offer lending 
products to our consumers and merchants in partnership with financial institutions.
We report our revenue under two lines, (i) Payment and Financial Services, and (ii) Commerce and 
Cloud Services.
Payment and Financial Services:
Our revenue from Payment and Financial services grew 83% to ₹3,858 Cr in FY2022 from ₹2,109 Cr in 
FY2021. We further split our Payment and Financial Services revenues into the following lines, (i) Payment 
Services to Consumers, (ii) Payment Services to Merchants, and (iii) Financial Services and Others.

Payment Services to Consumers includes revenues from the use cases such as bill payments and top-
ups on the Paytm platform. These revenues are primarily from, (i) the transaction fee that we charge 
our merchants based on a percentage of GMV, and (ii) consumer convenience fees that we charge our 
consumers for certain types of transactions. Revenue from payment services to consumers grew 58% to 
₹1,529 Cr in FY2022 from ₹969 Cr in FY2021, primarily due to a growth in the user base, increasing usage 
of the Paytm app and Paytm Payment instruments.
Payment Services to Merchants includes revenues from our comprehensive offerings of online and 
in-store payment acceptance services such as Payment Gateway, All-in-one and Dynamic-QR, 
POS, and Soundbox. These revenues are primarily from, (i) the transaction fee that we charge our 
merchants based on a percentage of GMV and (ii) recurring subscription fees from merchants for 
certain products and services, such as Paytm Soundbox and POS. Revenue from payment services 
to merchants grew 87% to ₹1,892 Cr in FY2022 from ₹1,012 Cr in FY2021, primarily due to new large 
partnerships in payment gateway and an increase in our device merchant base.

Financial Services and Others include revenues that we make from our financial services partners or 
consumers from our financial services offerings, primarily lending. Revenue from financial services 
and others grew 240% to ₹437 Cr in FY2022 from ₹128 Cr in FY2021, primarily driven by 441% Y-o-Y 
growth in the value of loans disbursed in FY 2022 to ₹7,623 Cr, from ₹1,409 Cr in FY2021.
Commerce and Cloud Services:
In commerce services, we generate revenue by levying a transaction fee to our merchant partners 
and/or a convenience fee to our customers, typically linked to a percentage of the transaction value 
of use cases such as ticketing for travel and entertainment and deals. The revenues grew 52% to 
₹374 Cr in FY2022 from ₹245 Cr in FY2021, primarily due to gradual ease in COVID-19 restrictions on 
transport, travel, and social distancing.
In cloud services, we generate revenue by charging our merchant partners a fee (subscription and 
volume linked) for utilizing our cloud and software solutions and our advertising partners, depending 
on the scale and type of campaign. The revenue from cloud services grew 63% to ₹731 Cr in FY2022 
from ₹448 Cr in FY2021, primarily due to an increase in Advertising and PAI cloud.

Drivers for Growth and Opportunities
Our ecosystem allows us to address large market opportunities: As India’s leading digital ecosystem 
for consumers and merchants, we have built the largest payments platform in number of consumers 
and merchants. Customers use various payment services on our platform, and merchants use us to 
accept payments and grow their business. We also provide financial services through our financial 
institution partners, particularly lending. Payments is a universal need for consumers and merchants, 
and provides us an attractive way of acquiring, retaining and monetising customers and merchants. 
It continues to give us very high engagement, and in addition, we believe we can make substantial 
revenues and profits in payments. Digital distribution of credit is a very large and scalable profit pool 
in India. Our ecosystem allows us to address these multiple large market opportunities at scale and 
gives us multiple growth vectors.

Our insights of Indian consumers and merchants: We have developed unparalleled insights into 
the way Indian consumers spend and save, and the way merchants operate their businesses. Being 
in the middle of payments flows between consumers and merchants, and transacting the largest 
peer to merchant payments volumes in India, gives us a large amount of transactional insights on our 
consumers and merchants which helps us design and show customized Paytm products, including 
some in partnership with financial institution partners. 
Our network effect creates sustainable advantages for us: We believe that our brand, distribution, 
insights, technology skills, and the scope of our ecosystem (i) give us an advantage to grow our 
business through, cost-effective acquisition of consumers and merchants; (ii) reinforce our platform 
by building higher engagement and stickiness with consumers and merchants; and (iii) build high 
monetisation products at low cost of acquisition.
Our product and technology DNA: Our technology stack is built ground up and integrated across 
all aspects of our ecosystem. We are the only payments company in India that, together with our 
affiliates, owns each layer of the payment stack. This allows us to integrate our payments offering 
seamlessly with other offerings. Similarly, for financial services, our technology infrastructure is built 
on a stack that is owned, controlled and written by us, our respective subsidiaries or associates. Our 
technology ownership and scope of our ecosystem has allowed us (and our associates, and financial 
institution partners) to offer services such as Paytm Wallet, Paytm QR, Paytm Soundbox, Gold 
investments and Fixed Deposit, Paytm Postpaid, Merchant Cash Advance and FASTag. All of these 
products aim to improve the experience of consumers and merchants who use it in our ecosystem.
Enabling regulatory environment: In our view, the regulatory environment in India remains 
constructive and supportive of digital payments and financial services. RBI in its Payments Vision 
2025 has reinforced the themes of enabling growth of digital payments across multiple instruments 
including UPI, PPI and cards. Regulatory compliance remains a key focus for us as an organization. 
Internal Control Systems and Risk Management Framework
In a rapidly evolving business, technical and regulatory environment coupled with dynamic consumer 
demands and growing competition, our risk profile is also evolving constantly. Our Company is 
cognizant that effective risk management is core to a sustainable business. We have therefore 
adopted a dynamic risk management framework that functions under the oversight of our Audit 
Committee and Risk Management Committee. 
Anti-money laundering and Counter-terrorism Financing Risk Management: To ensure clean day-
to-day operations, we have instituted comprehensive on-boarding and risk management practices, 
which include appropriate anti-money laundering policies and procedures.
Investments and Acquisitions Risk Management: To ensure that our investments and acquisitions 
are strategically complementary to our business, we have an identified team of professionals who 
manage our portfolio in alignment with the Company’s growth plans.
Business and Operational Risks
Covid-19 and economic environment: While Covid-19 and the economic downturn did impact 
businesses this fiscal, we managed it effectively and recorded a robust revenue growth of 77%. 
While we are doing all that is necessary and in our control, COVID-19 and any adversity in economic 
conditions can impact our business activities and revenue.
Financial: Growing engagement on our platform gives us monetization opportunities across payment, 
lending and commerce. We ended this fiscal year with strong growth. However, our operating expenses 
could increase as we hire additional personnel, broaden our marketing and promotional activities, 
enhance our platforms and offerings, expand our products and services, and develop our interface.

Pace of technology innovation: We make significant investments to constantly improve the scale, 
stability and functionality of our technology. Failure to maintain best-in-class technology infrastructure 
could harm our business and prospects.
Cybersecurity: Our platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for business continuity and 
to manage cybersecurity risks and data security breaches. We use analytics and machine learning 
to ensure optimum automated fraud detection during transaction processing. Encrypted data 
transmission using security protocols and algorithms ensures confidentiality and prevents leakage 
of confidential customer data. Data and technology infrastructures are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, 
as any such incident could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business. 
Regulatory:  Most of our businesses are subject to a fast evolving regulatory landscape. We are 
extremely focused on ensuring compliance with the statutory and regulatory framework, and are 
continuously strengthening our compliance processes and management depth. 
Competition: We consistently invest in enhancing our platform and customer-centric services in order 
to maintain our leadership. Our industry is extremely competitive, and consumers and merchants 
have multiple options. 
Litigation: We have a dedicated team to manage litigation risk and engage external consultants where 
necessary, thereby ensuring minimum impact of materiality. As a Company (or key management) we 
may be subject to legal proceedings, including ongoing litigation in tax, civil or other matters.
Material developments in Human Resources
In FY 2022, we had an average of 17,964 on-roll and 2,086 off-roll employees worldwide. We also 
engage contractors to provide us with a temporary workforce. None of our employees are represented 
by a labour union. We have not experienced any work stoppages since our incorporation.
Employee costs (excluding ESOP cost) as a % of revenue, moderated to 33% in FY2022 from 38% in 
FY2021. However, our Employee costs (excluding ESOP cost) at ₹1,623 Cr in FY 2022 grew 51% from 
₹1,072 Cr, as we strengthened our sales channel to drive penetration of our high margin use cases 
such as devices. We are also investing in our product and technology team to help scale our platform 
to support the next leg of users and transactions, and scaled up new services such as lending. 
Sustainability and Supporting our Community 
In our mission to bring half a billion Indians into the mainstream economy, we are governed by our 
values of serving the community, and maintaining trust while moving fast, responsibly and focusing 
on the underserved and unserved. Not only do we solve for our merchants receiving digital payments 
via various sources, and in turn, engaging more users, but also receive seamless access to micro-
credit, business payment solutions and wealth management, safely.
Financial Inclusion
We, at Paytm, firmly believe that technology when combined with a positive intent can create a 
huge impact. We are constantly working on innovative solutions that can make everyday life simpler: 
full-stack digital banking to underserved Indians, institutional financial services such as loans and 
bookkeeping and invoicing to micro, small and medium enterprises, and democratizing access to the 
formal credit and wealth management system.
As pioneers of India’s QR and mobile payments revolution, we continue to empower the grassroots 
of the country with robust digital payment solutions. We offer a series of smart devices to accelerate 
India’s digital payment penetration. Products such as the Paytm Soundbox have ensured that our 
country’s small shopkeepers never miss a digital payment and confidently complete transactions.

of life of women and to empower them. BC Sakhis are the fellow women members of respective 
SHGs (Self-help group), which in-turn has helped us to reach out to ever larger underserved groups. 
Engaging Users on Social Causes
As one of India’s largest digital platforms, we take pride in being able to mobilize our ecosystem 
participants in times of social and disaster relief. During the year we have continued to raise social 
awareness and raise contributions from our users to aid the Central and State governments, as 
well as independent local bodies, by enabling online payments to their preferred non-governmental 
organization or any other platform. 
COVID-19 Response
As an organized response to COVID-19, and to be prepared to serve our nation in the future, we set 
up the Paytm Foundation, as a Public Charitable Trust in India formed exclusively for philanthropic 
purposes in the areas of providing relief in times of natural calamities and disasters, supplementing 
need-based medical infrastructure, welfare of persons with disabilities, education and financial 
literacy, and advancement of general public utilities. 
We joined the Government of India’s PM-CARES fund collection efforts, with support from our 
consumers and merchants. We launched the India Fights Corona campaign to help prevent, and 
manage the spread of, COVID-19 in communities with the greatest need, by allowing users to donate 
for distribution of hygiene products among vulnerable sections of the society.
As a company, a special task force with employees stepped up across the country, to coordinate 
COVID-19 assistance in different cities in India. We also led a large-scale relief effort for the nation, 
by launching an OxygenforLife crowdfunding initiative for sourcing oxygen concentrators for donating 
to government hospitals, foundations and non-governmental organizations. Further, as a long-
term solution to meet oxygen demand, Paytm Foundation supported partner organizations to set 
up oxygen plants in selected government hospitals throughout the country. These helped produce 
medical oxygen from ambient air while simultaneously supplying the gas to multiple beds. So far, 17 
such plants have been donated by partner organizations and Paytm Foundation has facilitated the 
setting up of these oxygen plants and 1 oxygen plant has been set up by Paytm Foundation, making a 
total of 18 oxygen plants which have been setup and facilitated by Paytm Foundation.
We have introduced a dedicated section on our app, with a COVID-19 self-assessment scanning tool, 
which utilizes contract tracing to identify if one is potentially at risk of suffering from the virus. We 
have also leveraged our access to consumers and distribution, to help users find and book slots for 
COVID-19 vaccination, via a Vaccine Finder feature launched on our app.
International forums for Sustainability
We proudly represent our country on international forums working for sustainability. Since December 
2017, our Founder, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, has been the United Nations Environment Programme’s 
(“UNEP”) Patron for Clean Air, and helps drive greater environmental action and awareness to advocate 
for UNEP’s global #BreatheLife campaign – a major initiative on air quality seeking to influence policy 
and citizen action for a healthy future. Our Founder is also on the Advisory Board of the Green Digital 
Finance Alliance. The Alliance was set up by Ant Financial Services and UNEP to address the potential 
for digital finance and fintech-powered business innovations to reshape the financial system in ways 
that better align it with the needs of sustainable development.

a)	 Paytm Soundbox: The Company has come up 
with a unique feature in its EDCs devices (a kind 
of Point-of-Sale terminals) wherein it plays a sound 
notification for transaction confirmation. Every time 
a transaction is processed, the EDC device (called 
Sound-box) confirms the transactions through 
sound notification, thus annulling the need for 
paper slips for transaction confirmation.
	
	
The feature is available in 11 languages (English, 
Hindi, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Punjabi, 
Marathi, Gujarati, Bangla, Odia), which facilitated 
its usage across the country. In the last financial 
year (April 2021- March 2022), a total of 5045 
Million Sound-box-based transactions have been 
completed through Paytm-enabled sound boxes. 
This has enabled saving paper slips worth 4.43

paper).
	
b)	 Paytm QR Code: The Company has pioneered 
the use of QR codes initially through ‘Paytm 
Wallet’ and extended the same QR for UPI across 
India. This has helped in progressing towards the 
Government of India's vision of making India a 
cashless economy. Many customers make their 
daily transactions through Paytm wallet and UPI 
by scanning the QR code, thus obliviating the need 
to go to ATM machines to withdraw and carry 
cash. The QR code stickers provided by Paytm to 
all its merchants are recyclable in its nature. The 
Company is also helping in deepening the ‘financial 
inclusion agenda’ by onboarding street vendors

Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Assessment of carrying value of investment in 
subsidiaries, and associates carried at cost
(Refer accompanying notes 2.2(j), 2.2(n), 2.2 (u), 5, 6 
and 21 to the Standalone Financial Statements)
The 
Company 
has 
equity 
investments 
in 
various 
subsidiaries and associates. The Company accounts for 
equity investments in subsidiaries and associates at cost 
(subject to impairment assessment).
For investments carried at cost where an indication 
of impairment exists, the carrying value of investment 
is assessed for impairment and where applicable an 
impairment provision is recognized, if required.
The accounting for investments is a key audit matter as 
the determination of recoverable value for impairment 
assessment involves significant management judgement.
In measuring these investments, valuation methods are 
used based on inputs that are not directly observable from 
market information and certain other unobservable inputs. 
The key inputs and judgements involved in the impairment 
of investments include:
i)	 Forecast cash flows including assumptions on growth 
rates
ii)	 Discount rates
iii)	 Terminal growth rate
 Our procedures to assess the carrying value of investment 
(including impairment) in subsidiaries, and associates 
included the following:
•	
We obtained an understanding from the management, 
assessed and tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of the Company’s key controls over the 
impairment assessment of material investments.
•	
We evaluated the Company’s process regarding 
impairment assessment by involving auditor’s valuation 
experts to assist in assessing the appropriateness 
of the impairment model including the independent 
assessment of the underlying assumptions relating to 
cash flow, discount rate, terminal value, etc. for material 
investments.
•	
We checked the mathematical accuracy of the 
impairment model and agreed relevant data back to the 
latest budgets, actual past results and other supporting 
documents.
•	
We assessed the Company’s sensitivity analysis and 
evaluated whether any reasonably foreseeable change 
in assumptions could lead to impairment or material 
change in the carrying value.
•	
We assessed adequacy of relevant disclosures in the 
Standalone Financial Statements.
Based on the above audit procedures performed, the 
Management’s assessment of the carrying value of the 
investments was considered to be reasonable.
Other Information
6.	
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the other information. The other information comprises 
the Board’s Report, Corporate Governance Report, The 
Management Discussion and Analysis Report, Business 
Responsibility Report and Shareholder’s information, but 
does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and 
our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the Standalone 
Financial Statements does not cover the other information 
and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon. In connection with our audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone 
Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those 
Charged With Governance for the Standalone 
Financial Statements
7.	
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act 
with respect to the preparation of these Standalone 
Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of 
the financial position, financial performance, changes 
in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Accounting Standards specified 
under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility 
also includes maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation 
of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true 
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
8.	
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, 
management is responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Company or 
79
Independent 
Auditor’s 
Report
Annual Report 
2022

File: annual_report_22, Page number: 99
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to 
do so. Those Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
9.	
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these Standalone Financial Statements. 
10.	 As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	
•	
Identify 
and 
assess 
the 
risks 
of 
material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
Standalone 
Financial 
Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control. 
	
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the company 
has adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls. 
	
•	
Evaluate 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made  
by management.
	
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the Standalone 
Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Company to cease to 
continue as a going concern.  
	
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the financial statements, including 
the disclosures, and whether the Standalone 
Financial Statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.
11.	 We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
12.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable,  
related safeguards. 
13.	 From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
Report 
on 
Other 
Legal 
and 
Regulatory 
Requirements 
14.	 As required by the Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 
2020 (“the Order”), issued by the Central Government

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with

1.	
We have audited the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements of One 97 
Communications Limited (“the Company”) as of March 
31, 2022 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements of the Company for the year 
ended on that date.
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal 
Financial Controls
2.	
The Company’s management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(“ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its 
business, including adherence to company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company's internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the 
Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under 
Section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the 
ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in 
all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls system with reference to financial 
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial 
controls system with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to financial statements
6.	
A company's internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company's 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent 
Limitations 
of 
Internal 
Financial 
Controls with reference to financial statements
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements to future 
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, 
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate. 
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
an adequate internal financial controls system with 
reference to financial statements and such internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2022, based 
on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note issued by ICAI. Also refer paragraph 4 (a) of our 
main audit report.

Annexure B to Independent Auditor’s Report

showing full particulars of Intangible Assets.
	
(b)	 The Property, Plant and Equipment of the Company, 
are physically verified by the Management 
according to a phased programme designed to 
cover all the items over a period of three years 
which, in our opinion, is reasonable having regard 
to the size of the Company and the nature of its 
assets. Pursuant to the programme, a portion of the 
Property, Plant and Equipment has been physically 
verified by the Management during the year and 
no material discrepancies have been noticed on 
such verification. According to the information

user status’ of the customers which is tracked from 
the Company’s IT systems.

disclosed in Note 3(b) to the Standalone Financial 
Statements, are held in the name of the Company.   
	
(d)	 The Company has chosen cost model for its 
Property, Plant and Equipment (including Right of 
Use assets) and intangible assets. Consequently, 
the question of our commenting on whether the 
revaluation is based on the valuation by a Registered 
Valuer, or specifying the amount of change, if the 
change is 10% or more in the aggregate of the 
net carrying value of each class of Property, Plant 
and Equipment (including Right of Use assets) or 
intangible assets does not arise.  
	
(e)	 Based on the information and explanations 
furnished to us, no proceedings have been initiated 
on   the Company for holding benami property under 
the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions 
Act, 1988 (as amended in 2016) (formerly the 
Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 (45 of 
1988)) and Rules made thereunder, and therefore 
the question of our commenting on whether the 
Company has appropriately disclosed the details in 
its Standalone Financial Statements does not arise. 
ii. 	 (a)	 The Company is in the business of rendering 
services, and consequently, does not hold any 
inventory. Therefore, the provisions of Clause 3(ii)
(a) of the Order are not applicable to the Company.

books of account, as applicable (Also refer Note 41 (ii) 
to the Standalone Financial Statements).
iii.	
(a)	 The Company has made investments in 4 companies 
by way of subscribing to Optionally Convertible 
Debentures and granted unsecured loans to 5 
companies during the year. The aggregate amount of

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Title
Key requirements
Ind AS 16, Property, Plant and 
Equipment
Proceeds before intended use of property, plant and equipment:
The amendment clarifies that an entity shall deduct from the cost of an item 
of property, plant and equipment any proceeds received from selling items 
produced while the entity is preparing the asset for its intended use (for example, 
the proceeds from selling samples produced when testing a machine to see if it 
is functioning properly).
Ind AS 37, Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets
Onerous Contracts – Cost of fulfilling a contract:
The amendment explains that the cost of fulfilling a contract comprises: the 
incremental costs of fulfilling that contract and an allocation of other costs that 
relate directly to fulfilling contracts.
Ind AS 103, Business combinations
References to the conceptual framework:
The amendment adds a new exception in Ind AS 103 for liabilities and contingent 
liabilities.
Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments
Fees included in the 10% test for derecognition of financial liabilities:
The amendment clarifies which fees an entity includes when it applies the ‘10%’ test 
in assessing whether to derecognise a financial liability. An entity includes only fees 
paid or received between the entity (the borrower) and the lender, including fees 
paid or received by either the entity or the lender on the other’s behalf.
Ind AS 101, First time adoption
Subsidiary as a first-time adopter:
Simplifies the application of Ind AS 101 by a subsidiary that becomes a first-time 
adopter after its parent in relation to the measurement of cumulative translation 
differences.
Ind AS 41, Agriculture
Taxation in fair value measurements:
The amendment removes the requirement in Ind AS 41 for entities to exclude cash 
flows for taxation when measuring fair value. This aligns the fair value measurement 
in Ind AS 41 with the requirements of Ind AS 113, Fair Value Measurement.
	
These amendments are not expected to have a material 
impact on the Company in the current or future reporting 
periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

comes into effect and will record any related impact in 
the period the Code becomes effective.
	
All the amounts included in the financial statements are 
presented in Indian Rupees (‘Rupees’ or ‘Rs.’ or ‘INR’)

may result from COVID-19, on the carrying amount 
of the receivables, investments, goodwill etc. While 
making the assessment, the Company has taken 
cognizance of internal and external information up to 
the date of approval of these Financial Statements. 
The Company based on current estimates expects the 
carrying amount of the above assets will be recovered.
	
Management believes that it has taken into account 
all the possible impact of known events arising from 
COVID-19 pandemic in the preparation of the Financial 
Statements. However, the impact assessment of 
COVID-19 is a continuing process given the uncertainties 
associated with its nature and duration. The Company 
will continue to monitor any material changes to the 
future economic conditions.

An asset is classified as current when it is expected 
to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in 
normal operating cycle, held primarily for the purpose 
of trading, expected to be realised within twelve 
months after the reporting period, or cash or cash 
equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged 
or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period. All other assets are classified  
as non-current.
	
A liability is classified as current when it is expected to 
be settled in normal operating cycle, it is held primarily 
for the purpose of trading, it is due to be settled within 
twelve months after the reporting period, or there is 
no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the 
liability for at least twelve months after the reporting 
period. The Company classifies all other liabilities  
as non-current.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities, are classified as non-
current assets and liabilities.
	
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash 
and cash equivalents. The Company has identified 
twelve months as its operating cycle.
b. 
Foreign currencies
	
Functional and presentation currency
	
Items included in the financial statements of the 
Company are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which it operates 
i.e. the “functional currency”. The Company’s financial 
statements are presented in INR, which is also the 
Company’s functional currency. 
	
Transactions and balances
	
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded 
by the Company’s functional currency at exchange 
rates prevailing at the date the transaction first qualifies 
for recognition.
	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the functional currency 
spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange 
differences arising on settlement or translation of 
monetary items are recognised in profit or loss.
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.
	
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the 
date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss 
arising on translation of non-monetary items measured 
at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of 
the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item 
(i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value 
gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive 
income (“OCI”) or statement of profit and loss, are 
also recognised in OCI or statement of profit and  
loss, respectively).
c. 
Fair value measurement
	
The Company measures certain financial instruments 
(e.g. investments) at fair value at each balance  
sheet date. 
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. 
	
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the 
liabilities takes place either in the principal market for 
the asset or liability or in absence of principal market, in 
the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes 
into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and 
best use or by selling it to another market participant 
that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, 
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole:
	
Level 1- Quoted (Unadjusted) marked prices in the 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
Level 2- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable
	
Level 3- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable.
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company 
determines whether transfers have occurred between

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
At each reporting date, the management analyses the 
movements in the values of assets and liabilities which 
are required to be re-measured or re-assessed as per 
the Company’s accounting policies. For this analysis, 
the management or its expert verifies the major 
inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the 
information in the valuation computation to contracts 
and other relevant documents.
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the 
basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the 
asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy 
as explained above.
d. 
Revenue recognition
	
Revenue is measured based on the consideration 
specified in a contract with a customer net of variable 
consideration e.g. discounts, volume rebates, any 
payments made to a customer (unless the payment 
is for a distinct good or service received from the 
customer) and excludes amounts collected on behalf of 
third parties. The Company recognises revenue when it 
transfers control over a product or service to a customer. 
Revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal will not occur.
	
The Company provides incentives to its users in various 
forms including cashbacks. Incentives which are 
consideration payable to the customer that are not in 
exchange for a distinct good or service are generally 
recognized as a reduction of revenue.
	
Where the Company acts as an agent for selling goods 
or services, only the commission income is included 
within revenue. The specific revenue recognition 
criteria described below must also be met before 
revenue is recognized. Typically, the Company has a 
right to payment before or at the point that services 
are delivered. Cash received before the services are 
delivered is recognised as a contract liability. The 
amount of consideration does not contain a significant 
financing component as payment terms are less than 
one year. 
 
Sale of services 
	
Revenue from services is recognized when the control 
in services is transferred as per the terms of the 
agreement with customer i.e. as and when services 
are rendered. Revenues are disclosed net of the Goods 
and Services Tax charged on such services. In terms 
of the contract, excess of revenue over the billed at 
the year-end is carried in the balance sheet as trade 
receivables where the amount is recoverable from the 
customer without any future performance obligation 
and the Company has unconditional right over such 
consideration (i.e. if only the passage of time is required 
before payment of such consideration is due). Cash 
received before the services are delivered is recognised 
as a contract liability.
 
Commission
	
The Company facilitates recharge of talk time, bill 
payments and availability of bus tickets and earns 
commission for the respective services. Commission 
income is recognized when the control in services is 
transferred to the customer when the services have 
been provided by the Company.
 
Service fees from merchants
	
The Company earns service fee from merchants and 
recognizes such revenue when the control in services 
have been transferred by the Company i.e. as and when 
services have been provided by the Company. Such 
service fee is generally determined as a percentage of 
transaction value executed by the merchants. Amount 
received by the Company pending settlement are 
disclosed as payable to the merchants under other 
financial liabilities.
 
Government Grants
	
The Company recognises government grants only 
when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions 
attached to them will be complied with, and the grants 
will be received. Government grants related to revenue 
are recognized on a systematic basis in the Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss as other operating 
revenue over the periods necessary to match them 
with the related costs, if any, which they are intended 
to compensate.
 
Interest income
	
For all debt instruments measured either at amortised 
cost or at fair value through other comprehensive 
income, interest income is recorded using the effective 
interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts 
the estimated future cash payments or receipts over 
the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter 
period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount 
of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of a 
financial liability. When calculating the effective interest 
rate, the Company estimates the expected cash flows 
by considering all the contractual terms of the financial

instrument but does not consider the expected credit 
losses. Interest income is included in other income in 
the statement of profit and loss.
e. 
Taxes
 
Current income tax
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid 
to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws 
used to compute the amount are those that are enacted 
or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the 
countries where the Company operates and generates 
taxable income.
	
Current income tax relating to items recognised 
outside statement of profit and loss is recognised 
either in other comprehensive income or in equity. 
Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the 
underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation 
and considers whether it is probable that a taxation 
authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The 
Company measures its tax balances either based on the 
most likely amount or the expected value, depending 
on which method provides a better prediction of the 
resolution of the uncertainty. 
 
Deferred tax
	
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on 
temporary differences between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes at the reporting date.
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except:
	
When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, the carry forward of unused 
tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, and the carry 
forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses 
can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of 
the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting 
date and are recognised to the extent that it has 
become probable that future taxable profits will allow 
the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based 
on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside 
statement of profit and loss is recognised either in 
other comprehensive income or in equity. Deferred tax 
items are recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset 
if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred 
taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same 
taxation authority.
 
Minimum alternate tax
	
Credit of MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset only 
when it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the credit can be utilised. In the year in 
which the MAT credit becomes eligible to be recognised 
as an asset, the said asset is created by way of a 
credit to the statement of profit and loss account. The 
Company reviews the same at each balance sheet date 
and writes down the carrying amount of MAT credit 
entitlement to the extent it is no longer probable that 
the Company will pay normal income tax during the 
specified period.
 
Taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring 
expenses
	
Assets are recognised net of the amount of GST paid, 
except when the tax incurred on a purchase of assets 
is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which 
case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of 
acquisition of the asset
	
Expenses are recognised net of the amount of GST 
paid, except when the tax incurred on a purchase of 
services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, 
in which case, the tax paid is expensed off in statement 
of profit and loss
	
The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable 
to, the taxation authority is included as part of other

current/ non- current assets or other current liabilities 
in the balance sheet.
f. 
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations
	
The Company classifies non-current assets and 
disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts 
will be recovered principally through a sale rather than 
through continuing use. Actions required to complete 
the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant 
changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to 
sell will be withdrawn. Management must be committed 
to the sale expected within one year from the date  
of classification.
	
For 
these 
purposes, 
sale 
transactions 
include 
exchanges of non-current assets for other non-current 
assets when the exchange has commercial substance. 
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded 
met only when the assets or disposal group is available 
for immediate sale in its present condition, subject 
only to terms that are usual and customary for sales 
of such assets (or disposal groups), its sale is highly 
probable; and it will genuinely be sold, not abandoned. 
The Company treats sale of the asset or disposal group 
to be highly probable when:
	
•	
The appropriate level of management is committed 
to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group),
	
•	
An active programme to locate a buyer and 
complete the plan has been initiated (if applicable),
	
•	
The asset (or disposal group) is being actively 
marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in 
relation to its current fair value,
	
•	
The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as 
a completed sale within one year from the date of 
classification , and
	
•	
Actions required to complete the plan indicate that 
it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will 
be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
	
Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups 
are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and 
the fair value less costs to sell. Assets and liabilities 
classified as held for sale are presented separately in 
the Balance Sheet. 
	
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
once classified as held for sale are not depreciated  
or amortised.
	
A disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation 
if it is a component of an entity that either has been 
disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and:
	
•	
Represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations or
	
•	
Is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of 
a separate major line of business or geographical 
area of operations.
	
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results 
of continuing operations and are presented as a single 
amount as profit or loss after tax from discontinued 
operations in the statement of profit and loss.
g. 
Property, plant and equipment
	
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment, if any. Property, plant and equipment is 
depreciated on a written down value basis to its residual 
value over its estimated useful life. 
	
Costs directly attributable to acquisition are capitalized 
until the property, plant and equipment are ready for 
use, as intended by the management.  
	
Subsequent costs are capitalised on the carrying amount 
or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when future economic benefits associated with the 
item are probable to flow to the Company and cost of 
the item can be measured reliably. When significant 
parts of property, plant and equipment are required 
to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates 
them separately based on their specific useful lives. 
The carrying amount of any component accounted for 
as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All 
repair and maintenance are charged to statement of 
profit and loss during the reporting period in which they 
are incurred.
	
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, 
plant and equipment outstanding at each balance 
sheet date is classified as capital advances under the 
non-current assets and the cost of assets not ready to 
use before such date are disclosed under ‘Capital work  
in progress’.
	
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of 
an item of property, plant and equipment is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss on the date of disposal  
or retirement.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
Depreciation is provided using the written down value 
method and charged to statement of profit and loss, 
unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value 
of another asset, as per the rates prescribed under 
schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, except for 
technical evaluation done by the management's expert 
for plant and machinery, given below:
Assets

45.07%
Furniture and fittings
25.89%
Plant & Machinery
45.07% 
63.16%
Vehicles
31.23%
	
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the 
shorter of their useful life or the lease term, unless the 
entity expects to use the assets beyond the lease term.
	
The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
h. 
Intangible assets
	
Separately acquired intangible assets, such as software 
are measured initially at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if 
any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding 
capitalized development costs, are not capitalized and 
expenditure is reflected in the statement of profit and 
loss in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. 
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried 
at cost and are amortised on a written down value 
basis over their estimated useful lives and charged to 
statement of profit and loss.
	
Software and licenses acquired are amortized at the 
rate of 40% per annum on written down value method.
	
The amortization period and the amortization method 
are reviewed at least at each financial year end. Changes 
in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of 
consumption of future economic benefits embodied 
in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation 
period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as 
changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation 
expense on intangible assets is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure 
forms part of carrying value of another asset.
	
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an 
intangible asset are measured as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit 
and loss when the asset is derecognized.
 
Research and development costs
	
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development 
expenditure incurred on an individual project is 
recognized as an intangible asset when the Company 
can demonstrate all the following:
	
•	
The technical feasibility of completing the intangible 
asset so that it will be available for use or sale
	
•	
Its intention to complete the asset
	
•	
Its ability to use or sell the asset
	
•	
How the asset will generate future economic 
benefits
	
•	
The availability of adequate resources to complete 
the development and to use or sell the asset
	
•	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure 
attributable 
to 
the 
intangible 
asset 
during 
development.
	
Following the initial recognition of the development 
expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied 
requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment 
losses. Amortization of the asset begins when 
development is complete and the asset is available 
for use. It is amortized on a straight line basis over 
the period of expected future benefit from the related 
project, i.e., the estimated useful life of one to five years. 
Amortization is recognized in the statement of profit and 
loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value 
of another asset. During the period of development, the 
asset is tested for impairment annually.
i. 
Borrowing costs
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its 
intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost 
of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in 
the period in the statement of profit and loss in which 
they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and 
other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the 
borrowing of funds.

j. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
For all non-financial assets, the Company assesses 
whether there are indicators of impairment. If such 
an indicator exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are independent from 
other assets, the Company estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the 
asset belongs.
	
The recoverable amount for an asset or CGU is the 
higher of its value in use and fair value less costs of 
disposal. If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
asset or CGU is considered impaired and the carrying 
amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately 
in the statement of profit and loss. 
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows of the asset or CGU are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair 
value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions 
are taken into account. 
	
If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate 
valuation model is used. These calculations are 
corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share 
prices for publicly traded companies or other available 
fair value indicators.
	
The Company bases its impairment calculation on 
detailed budgets and forecast calculations. These 
budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a 
period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term 
growth rate is calculated and applied to project future 
cash flows after the fifth year. To estimate cash flow 
projections beyond periods covered by the most 
recent budgets/forecasts, the Company extrapolates 
cash flow projections in the budget using a steady or 
declining growth rate for subsequent years, unless an 
increasing rate can be justified. In any case, this growth 
rate does not exceed the long-term average growth 
rate for the products, industries, or country or countries 
in which the entity operates, or for the market in which 
the asset is used.
	
An assessment is made at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is an indication that previously 
recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have 
decreased. If such indication exists, the Company 
estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A 
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only 
if there has been a change in the assumptions used 
to determine the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount 
since the last impairment loss was recognised. The 
reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the 
asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such 
reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
k. 
Provisions and contingencies
 
Provisions
	
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a 
present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of 
a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation. 
	
When the Company expects some or all of a provision 
to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as 
a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is 
virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision 
is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of  
any reimbursement.
	
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a 
finance cost.
 
Contingencies
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events beyond the control of the 
Company or a present obligation that is not recognized 
because it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent 
liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there 
is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot 
be measured reliably. The Company does not recognize 
a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the 
financial statements.
l. 
Retirement and other employee benefits
	
For defined benefit plans (gratuity), the liability or asset 
recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting 
period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined 
benefit obligation is calculated by an independent 
actuary using the projected unit credit method.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the 
reporting period on government bonds that have terms 
approximating to the terms of the related obligation.
	
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the 
discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit 
obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is 
included in employee benefit expense in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
Re-measurement gains and losses arising from 
experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are recognised in the period in which 
they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. 
They are included in retained earnings in the statement 
of changes in equity and in the balance sheet. Re-
measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in 
the subsequent periods.
	
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation 
resulting 
from 
plan 
amendments 
or 
curtailments are recognised immediately in profit or 
loss as past service cost.
	
The Company’s contributions to defined contribution 
plans (provident fund) are recognized in profit or 
loss when the employee renders related service. The 
Company has no further obligations under these plans 
beyond its periodic contributions.
	
The Company provides for liability at year end on 
account of un-availed earned leave as per actuarial 
valuation using projected unit credit method.
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-
monetary benefits that are expected to be settled 
wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in 
which the employees render the related service are 
recognised in respect of employees’ services up to 
the end of the reporting period and are measured at 
the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities 
are settled. The liabilities are presented as employee 
benefit payable under other financial liabilities in the 
balance sheet.
m. Share-based payments
 
i) 
Equity-settled transactions
	
	
Employees (including senior executives) of the 
Company receive remuneration in the form of 
share-based payments, whereby employees render 
services as consideration for equity instruments 
(equity-settled transactions).
	
	
The 
cost 
of 
equity-settled 
transactions 
is 
determined by the fair value at the date when the 
grant is made using an appropriate valuation model.
	
	
That 
cost 
is 
recognised, 
together 
with 
a 
corresponding increase in Employee Stock Option 
Plan (ESOP) reserves in equity, over the period in 
which the performance and/or service conditions 
are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The 
cumulative 
expense 
recognised 
for 
equity-
settled transactions at each reporting date until 
the vesting date reflects the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired and the Company’s 
best estimate of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest. The statement of profit 
and loss expense or credit for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognised 
as at the beginning and end of that period and is 
recognised in employee benefits expense.
	
	
Performance 
conditions 
which 
are 
market 
conditions are taken into account when determining 
the grant date fair value of the awards. Service and 
non-market performance conditions are not taken 
into account when determining the grant date fair 
value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions 
being met is assessed as part of the Company’s 
best estimate of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest.
	
	
No expense is recognised for awards that do not 
ultimately vest because non-market performance 
and/or service conditions have not been met.
	
	
When the terms of an equity-settled award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised is the 
expense had the terms not been modified, if the 
original terms of the award are met. An additional 
expense is recognised for any modification that 
increases the total fair value of the share-based 
payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial 
to the employee as measured at the date of 
modification. Where an award is cancelled by 
the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining 
element of the fair value of the award is expensed 
immediately through profit or loss.
	
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is 
reflected as additional share dilution in the 
computation of diluted earnings per share.
 
ii) 
Cash-settled transactions
	
	
For awards classified as cash settled share based 
transactions, the goods or services acquired are 
measured and the liability incurred, at the fair value

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
of liability. Until the liability is settled, the fair value 
of the liability is re-measured at the end of each 
reporting period and at the date of settlement, with 
any changes in fair value recognised in statement 
of profit and loss for the period.
	
	
The cost of cash-settled transactions is determined 
by the fair value of equity instruments at each 
reporting date using an appropriate valuation model.
	
	
That 
cost 
is 
recognised, 
together 
with 
a 
corresponding increase in liability, over the 
period in which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits 
expense. The cumulative expense recognised for 
cash-settled transactions at each reporting date 
until the vesting date reflects the extent to which 
the vesting period has expired and the Company’s 
best estimate of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest. The statement of profit 
and loss expense or credit for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognised 
as at the beginning and end of that period and is 
recognised in employee benefits expense.
	
	
No expense is recognised for awards that do not 
ultimately vest because non-market performance 
and/or service conditions have not been met.
	
	
The Company has set up Paytm Associate Benefit 
Welfare Trust (formerly known as One97 Employee 
Welfare Trust) for administering certain types of 
share-based payment arrangements including 
awards given to employees of the outside group 
companies as well for awards of options of other 
companies given to its employees. The Company 
uses the Trust as a vehicle for distributing shares 
under the ESOP schemes. The Trust holds shares 
of the Company, for giving shares to employees. 
The Company treats the Trust as its extension and 
shares of the Company held by Trust are treated as 
treasury shares. Other assets held by the Trust are 
consolidated on a line-by-line basis with Company’s 
financial statements. Shares of other companies 
held by the Trust for distribution to its employees 
are separately disclosed under investments.
	
	
The Company has lost control over the Trust and 
accordingly, it is now not consolidated on a line-by-
line basis with Company’s financial statements. 
n. 
Financial instruments
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.
 
Financial assets
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value 
plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are 
attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.
	
Subsequent measurement
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified in four categories:
	
•	
Debt instruments at amortized cost
	
•	
Debt instruments at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
	
•	
Debt 
instruments, 
derivatives 
and 
equity 
instruments at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL)
	
•	
Equity instruments measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
	
Debt instruments at amortised cost
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if 
both the following conditions are met:
	
a)	
The asset is held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
	
b)	 Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal  
amount outstanding.
	
After initial measurement, such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost 
is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included 
in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses 
arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or 
loss. This category generally applies to trade and other 
receivables and is most relevant to the Company.
	
Debt instrument at FVTOCI
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both 
of the following criteria are met:
	
a)	
The objective of the business model is achieved 
both by collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling the financial assets,   and
105
Notes to the 
Standalone Financial 
Statements
Annual Report 
2022

File: annual_report_22, Page number: 125
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
b)	 The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
	
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category 
are measured initially as well as at each reporting date 
at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in 
the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the 
Company recognizes interest income, impairment 
losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss 
in the statement of profit and loss. On derecognition of 
the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
in OCI is reclassified from the equity to the statement 
of profit and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI 
debt instrument is reported as interest income using 
the EIR method.
	
Debt instrument at FVTPL
	
FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any 
debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for 
categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is 
classified as at FVTPL.
	
In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt 
instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or 
FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election 
is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a 
measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to 
as ‘accounting mismatch’). 
	
Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category 
are measured at fair value with all changes recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss.
	
Equity investments
	
All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are 
measured at fair value. The Company may make an 
irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive 
income subsequent changes in the fair value. The 
Company makes such election on an instrument-by-
instrument basis. The classification is made on initial 
recognition and is irrevocable.
	
If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument 
as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the 
OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to 
statement of profit or loss, even on sale of investment. 
However, the Company may transfer the cumulative 
gain or loss within equity.
	
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category 
are measured at fair value with all changes recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss.
	
The equity securities which are not held for trading, 
and for which the Company has made an irrevocable 
election at initial recognition to recognize changes in 
fair value through OCI rather than profit or loss as these 
are strategic investments and the Company considered 
this to be more relevant.
	
Equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint 
ventures are measured at cost. The investments are 
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment considering the 
provisions of Ind AS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. If any 
such indication exists, policy for impairment of non-
financial assets is followed.
	
Derecognition
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the 
Company’s balance sheet) when:
	
•	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired, or
	
•	
The Company has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party under a 
‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the 
Company has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.
	
When the Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into 
a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to 
what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of 
ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, 
nor transferred control of the asset, the Company 
continues to recognise the transferred asset to the 
extent of the Company’s continuing involvement. In 
that case, the Company also recognises an associated 
liability. The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights 
and obligations that the Company has retained.
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies 
expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and 
recognition of impairment loss on financial assets that 
are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised 
cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits, trade 
receivables and bank balance.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
The 
Company 
follows 
‘simplified 
approach’ 
for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade 
receivables. The application of simplified approach does 
not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. 
Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based 
on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its 
initial recognition. 
	
For recognition of impairment loss on other financial 
assets and risk exposure, the Company determines that 
whether there has been a significant increase in the 
credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not 
increased significantly, 12-month expected credit loss 
(ECL) is used to provide for impairment loss. However, 
if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is 
used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the 
instrument improves such that there is no longer a 
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, 
then the entity reverts to recognising impairment loss 
allowance based on 12-month ECL.
	
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting 
from all possible default events over the expected life of 
a financial instrument. The 12-month ECL is a portion of 
the lifetime ECL which results from default events that 
are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. 
	
ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows 
that are due to the Company in accordance with the 
contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects 
to receive (i.e., all cash shortfalls), discounted at the 
original EIR.
	
The Company uses a provision matrix to determine 
impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade 
receivables. The provision matrix is based on its 
historically observed default rates over the expected 
life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-
looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical 
observed default rates are updated and changes in the 
forward-looking estimates are analyzed.
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized 
during the period is recognized as income/ expense in 
the statement of profit and loss. This amount is reflected 
under the head other expenses in the statement of 
profit and loss. For the financial assets measured as 
at amortised cost, ECL is presented as an allowance, 
i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of those 
assets in the balance sheet. The allowance reduces 
the net carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-
off criteria, the Company does not reduce impairment 
allowance from the gross carrying amount.
 
Financial liabilities
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, 
as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in an effective 
hedge, as appropriate.
	
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, 
net of directly attributable transaction costs.
	
The Company’s financial liabilities include borrowings, 
lease liabilities, trade and other payables. 
	
Subsequent measurement
	
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on 
their classification as described below: 
	
Loans and borrowings
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in 
profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well 
as through the EIR amortisation process.
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs 
that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation 
is included as finance costs in the statement of profit 
and loss.
	
Derecognition
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially different terms, 
or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated 
as the derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the 
statement of profit or loss.
	
Embedded derivatives
	
An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid 
(combined) instrument that also includes a non-
derivative host contract – with the effect that some of 
the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a 
way similar to a stand-alone derivative. An embedded 
107
Notes to the 
Standalone Financial 
Statements
Annual Report 
2022

File: annual_report_22, Page number: 127
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
derivative causes some or all of the cash flows that 
otherwise would be required by the contract to be 
modified according to a specified interest rate, financial 
instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange 
rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit 
index, or other variable, provided in the case of a non-
financial variable that the variable is not specific to a 
party to the contract.  
	
Reassessment only occurs if there is either a change 
in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies 
the cash flows that would otherwise be required or a 
reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair value 
through profit or loss.
	
If the hybrid contract contains a host that is a financial 
asset within the scope of Ind AS 109, the Company does 
not separate embedded derivatives. Rather, it applies 
the classification requirements contained in Ind AS 109 
to the entire hybrid contract. Derivatives embedded in 
all other host contracts are accounted for as separate 
derivatives and recorded at fair value if their economic 
characteristics and risks are not closely related to those 
of the host contracts and the host contracts are not held 
for trading or designated at fair value though profit or 
loss. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair 
value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or 
loss, unless designated as effective hedging instruments.
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet 
if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously.
o. 
Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the standalone balance 
sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity of three months 
or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
	
For the purpose of the standalone statement of cash 
flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash 
and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an 
integral part of the Company’s cash management.
p. 
Leases
 
The Company as a lessee
	
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist 
of leases for land and office premises. The Company 
assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at 
inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a 
lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use 
of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration. To assess whether a contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified 
asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) the contact 
involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company 
has substantially all of the economic benefits from use 
of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the 
Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements 
in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term 
of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and 
low value leases. For these short-term and low value 
leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as 
an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the 
term of the lease.
	
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to 
extend or terminate the lease before the end of the 
lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably certain that they 
will be exercised.
	
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, 
which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the 
commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct 
costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any.
	
Right-of-use 
assets 
are 
depreciated 
from 
the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated 
for recoverability whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of 
the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) 
is determined on an individual asset basis unless the 
asset does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. In such cases, 
the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash 
Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
	
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized 
cost at the present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using the interest 
rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates in the country 
of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the 
related right of use asset if the Company changes its 
assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a 
termination option.
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately 
presented in the standalone balance sheet and lease 
payments have been classified as financing cash flows.
q. 
Earnings/ (loss) per share (EPS)
	
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/
(loss) for the year attributable to equity holders by the 
weighted average number of Equity shares outstanding 
during the year excluding the treasury shares.
	
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the 
profit/(loss) attributable to equity holders by the 
weighted average number of Equity shares outstanding 
during the year plus the weighted average number of 
Equity shares that would be issued on conversion of all 
the dilutive potential Equity shares into Equity shares.
r. 
Treasury shares
	
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury 
shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from 
equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss 
on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the 
Company’s own equity instruments. Any difference 
between the carrying amount and the consideration, if 
reissued, is recognised in other reserve.
s. 
Segment reporting
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
chief operating decision-maker. The Chief Operating 
decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources 
and assessing performance of the operating segments 
and makes strategic decisions. Refer note 33 for 
segment information presented.
t. 
Use of estimates 
	
The Company is required to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date 
of the financial statements and the reported amounts 
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The 
Company bases its estimates on historical experience 
and on various other assumptions that are believed to 
be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for 
making judgements about carrying values of assets  
and liabilities.
u. 
Exceptional Items
	
On certain occasions, the size, type or incidence of an 
item of income or expense, pertaining to the ordinary 
activities of the Company is such that its disclosure 
improves the understanding of the performance of the 
Company. Such income or expense is classified as an 
exceptional item and accordingly disclosed in the financial 
statements. Significant impact on the financial statements 
arising from impairment of investments in subsidiaries 
and associates, gain/ loss on disposal of subsidiaries and 
associates (other than major lines of business that meet 
the definition of a discontinued operation) are considered 
and reported as exceptional items.
v. 
Contributed Equity
 
Equity shares are classified as equity.
	
The transaction costs of an equity transaction are 
accounted for as a deduction from equity (net of any 
related income tax benefit) to the extent they are 
incremental costs directly attributable to the equity 
transaction that otherwise would have been avoided. 
Qualifying transaction costs incurred in anticipation of 
an issuance of equity instruments is deferred on the 
balance sheet until the equity instrument is recognised. 
Deferred costs are subsequently reclassified as a 
deduction from equity when the equity instruments 
are recognised. If the equity instruments are not 
subsequently issued, the deferred transaction costs 
are charged off to profit or loss.
	
The transaction costs incurred with respect to the IPO 
of the Company as reduced by the amount recovered 
from the selling shareholders are allocated between 
new issue of shares and listing of existing equity shares. 
The costs attributable to listing of existing shares is 
recognised in profit or loss and the costs attributable to 
new issuance of shares is recognised in equity.

Limited and Wasteland Entertainment Private Limited has recognized provision for impairment in the carrying value of 
its investments of H 132 and H 200 (March 31, 2021 : H 350 and H Nil), respectively, which has been shown as exceptional 
item in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended March 31, 2022. During current and previous 
year, the impairment loss for Orbgen Technologies Private Limited and Wasteland Entertainment Private Limited was 
based on the equity value calculated based on cash flow projections with the business plan used for impairment testing 
using discounted cash flow method. The management has computed equity value of Orbgen Technologies Private 
Limited and Wasteland Entertainment Private Limited based on discount rate of 22.5% and terminal growth rate used in 
extrapolating cash flows beyond the planning period of 2.45 times of revenue of the terminal year.
b)	 The Company basis its assessment of future business projections of its associate, Eatgood Technologies Private Limited, 
has recognized provision of H 30 (March 31, 2021: 300) for impairment in the carrying value of its investment. During 
current and previous year, the management has computed equity value of Eatgood Technologies Private Limited based 
on discount rate of 17.24% and terminal growth rate used in extrapolating cash flows is 3.8%.
c)

Internet Private Limited). The Company has the rights of conversion into a fixed number of equity shares. The investment 
has been fair valued through profit and loss (FVTPL) since it does not meet the SPPI test. The difference in fair value of

22. Earnings per shares (EPS)
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/ (loss) for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/ (loss) attributable to equity holders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of equity shares 
that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:
* In view of losses during the current year and previous year, the options which are anti-dilutive have been ignored in the calculation of diluted earnings 
per share. Accordingly, there is no variation between basic and diluted earnings per share.
# Pursuant to the approval of the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on June 30, 2021, each equity share of face value 
of H 10 per share was sub-divided into ten equity shares of face value of H 1 per share, with effect from record date, i.e., June 30, 2021. Consequently, 
the basic and diluted earnings per share have been computed for current year and previous year on the basis of the new number of equity shares in 
accordance with Ind AS 33, Earning per share.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
23. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Company’s Standalone Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying 
disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in 
outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 12 months, 
are described below.
Deferred taxes
Deferred tax assets can be recognised for deductible temporary differences (including unused tax losses) only to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. As 
the Company is yet to generate operating profits, Management has assessed that as at March 31, 2022 it is not probable 
that such deferred tax assets can be realised in excess of available taxable temporary differences. Management re-assesses 
unrecognised deferred tax assets at each reporting date and recognises to the extent that it has become probable that 
future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. For details about deferred tax assets, refer note 27.
During FY 2019-20 (AY 2020-21) a shareholder of the Company holding 30.33% of shares of the Company has transferred its 
shareholding to its group company (both entities being 100% subsidiaries of the same ultimate parent entity). Based on advice 
from the Company's tax experts, Management has assessed that a mere change in shareholding within the same group will not 
be an affirmative position to say that the shareholding has been changed. Further, since the shares of the Company carrying not 
less than fifty-one percent of the voting power were beneficially held by persons, i.e. ultimate holding company of the aforesaid 
entities, who beneficially held shares of the company carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power on the last day 
of the year or years in which the loss was incurred, the Company shall be entitled to carry forward and set off these losses against 
the taxable income of future years in accordance with the provisions of Section 79 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. (refer note 27)
Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits) 
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial 
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the 
future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in 
these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated in India, the management considers the interest rates of 
government bonds in India. The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables for India. The mortality tables 
tend to change only at interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are 
based on expected future inflation rates. For further details about gratuity obligations, refer note 26.
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the standalone balance sheet cannot be measured 
based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the DCF model, 
Price of Recent Investment (PORI) method and Comparable Company Multiples (CCM) method. The inputs to these models 
are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in 
establishing fair values. For further details about Fair value measurement, refer note 30.
Impairment of financial assets	
The Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit risk associated with its assets carried at amortised 
cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. Note 31 
details how the Company determines whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
Impairment reviews
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are tested for impairment at-least on an annual basis or when events that occur 
/ changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount is less than its carrying value. In calculating the value in

use, the Company is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions inter-alia concerning the growth in EBITDA, 
long-term growth rates; discount rates to reflect the risks involved. For details about impairment reviews, refer note 21.
Incentives
The Company provides incentives to users in various forms including cash backs to promote our platform. Incentives to users 
to whom the Company has a performance obligation is recorded as a reduction of revenue to the extent of the revenue earned. 
For the incentives to other transacting users to whom the Company has no performance obligation, management is required to 
determine whether the incentives are in substance a payment on behalf of the merchants and should therefore be recorded as a 
reduction of revenue or as marketing and promotional expenses. Some of the factors considered in management’s evaluation of 
such incentives being payments on behalf of  merchants include whether the incentives are given at the Company’s discretion, 
contractual agreements with the merchants, business strategy and objectives and design of the incentive program(s), etc

26. Gratuity
The Company provides for gratuity for employees in India as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Employees who are in 
continuous service for a period of 5 years are eligible for gratuity. The amount of gratuity payable on retirement/termination 
is the employees last drawn basic salary per month computed proportionately for 15 days salary multiplied for the number 
of years of service. The gratuity plan is a funded plan and the Company makes contributions to recognised fund/insurer in 
India. The Company does not fully fund the liability and maintains a target level of funding to be maintained over a period of 
time based on estimations of expected gratuity payments. Disclosures given below are as per actuarial valuation report of

A quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant assumption as at March 31, 2022 is as shown below:
 
A quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant assumption as at March 31, 2021 is as shown below:
	
The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined 
benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. The 
methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensivity analysis did not change compared to the prior year.
	
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the period ending March 31, 2023 are H 162 (March 31, 
2022 - H 113).
	
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 2.78 years (March 31, 2021- 2.76 years). 
	
The average remaining working life of members of the defined benefit obligation as at March 31, 2022 is 29.91 years (as 
at March 31, 2021- 29.06 years)
 
The expected maturity analysis of gratuity is as follows:
 
Risk exposure
	
Through its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are 
detailed below:

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
Asset volatility: The plan assets are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond yields. If plan assets 
underperform this yield, there will be a deficit of the plan asset investments in fixed income securities with high grades 
and in government securities. These are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk to an 
acceptable level.
	
Changes in bond yields: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If 
bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
	
Inflation risks: The payments are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.  
	
Life expectancy: Obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy and 
inflation will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. This is particularly significant where inflationary conditions result 
in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.

31.	Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The 
Company continues to focus on a system-based approach to business risk management. The Company’s financial risk 
management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of key risks facing 
the business. Backed by strong internal control systems, the current Risk Management Framework rests on policies and 
procedures issued by appropriate authorities; process of regular internal reviews/audits to set appropriate risk limits and 
controls; monitoring of such risks and compliance confirmation for the same.
a.	 Market Risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market prices comprise three types of risk: interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and price risk. The 
Company has in place appropriate risk management policies to limit the impact of these risks on its financial performance. 
The Company ensures optimization of cash through fund planning and robust cash management practices.
 
(i) Interest Rate Risk
	
	
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates.
	
	
The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s borrowings 
with floating interest rates.
	
	
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, being a 0.5% 
increase or decrease in interest rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Company’s loss before tax due to 
the impact on floating rate borrowings.
As at
March 31, 2022
March 31, 2021
Effect on loss before tax:
Decrease by 50 bps
Nil
(27)
Increase by 50 bps
Nil 
27
	
	
Other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are either non-interest bearing or fixed interest bearing 
instruments, the Company’s net exposure to interest risk on such instruments is negligible.
	
	
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a reasonably possible change in the under-lying interest rate of the 
Company’s borrowings while assuming all other variables to be constant. 
	
	
Based on the movements in the interest rates historically and the prevailing market conditions as at the reporting 
date, the Company’s management has concluded that the above mentioned rates used for sensitivity are reasonable 
benchmarks.
 
(ii) Price risk
	
	
The Company invests its surplus funds in various debt instruments, fixed deposits and debt mutual funds. These 
comprise of primarily debt based mutual funds (liquid investments), debentures and fixed deposits. As on March 31, 
2021, all mutual fund investments were in liquid scheme only.
	
	
Mutual fund investments are susceptible to market price risk, mainly arising from changes in the interest rates or 
market yields which may impact the return and value of such investments.
	
	
Set out below is the impact of a 0.25% movement in the NAV of mutual funds and debt instruments on the Company’s 
loss before tax:

The Company is also exposed to equity/ preference shares price risk arising from investments held by the Company 
and classified in the balance sheet either as fair value through OCI or at fair value through profit or loss (refer 
note 7(a) and 7(b)). To manage its price risk arising from investments in equity/ preference shares, the company 
diversifies its portfolio. Diversification of the portfolio is done in accordance with the limits set by the company.
 
(iii) Foreign currency risk
	
	
The Indian Rupee is the Company’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the Company’s results are 
presented in Indian Rupee and exposures are managed against Indian Rupee accordingly. Foreign currency risk 
is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the 
Company’s operating activities and investing activities (when revenue, expense and Property, Plant and Equipment 
is denominated in a foreign currency).
	
	
The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities denominated in United States Dollar (USD), 
Canadian Dollar (CAD) and Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) are as follows:

31.	Financial risk management objectives and policies (Contd..)
	
	
The Company’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.
	
	
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a reasonably possible change in the under-lying foreign currency against 
the functional currency while assuming all other variables to be constant.
	
	
Based on the movements in the foreign exchange rates historically and the prevailing market conditions as at the 
reporting date, the Company’s management has concluded that the above mentioned rates used for sensitivity are 
reasonable benchmarks.
b.	 Credit Risk
	
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or contract, leading to a 
financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) including 
deposits with banks. Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an  
ongoing basis. 
	
All of the entity's investments and loans at amortised cost are considered to have low credit risk, and the loss allowance 
recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 months expected losses. Management considers instruments 
to be low credit risk when they have a low risk of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual 
cash flow obligations in the near term.
 
(i) Trade receivables
	
	
The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers. Customer credit risk is managed 
subject to the Company’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. 
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date by grouping the receivables in homogeneous group. The 
calculation is based on lifetime expected credit losses.

32. Capital Management
The Company’s objectives while managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to generate 
adequate returns for its shareholders and ensuring benefits for other stakeholders. The key objective of the Company’s 
capital management is to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with the focus on total equity, uphold investor; 
creditor and customer confidence, and ensure future development of its business activities. The Company manages its 
capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions or its business requirements.
Company's capital management objective is to remain majorly a debt-free company till the time it achieves break-even. In 
order to meet this objective, Company meets anticipated funding requirements for developing new businesses, expanding 
its geographical base, entering in to strategic mergers and acquisitions and other strategic investments, by issuance of 
equity capital together with cash generated from Company’s operating and investing activities. The company utilizes certain 
working capital facilities in the form of short term bank overdraft to meet anticipated interim working capital requirements. 
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the year ended March 31, 2022 
and March 31, 2021.
33. Segment Reporting
During the previous year ended March 31, 2021, the Company reassessed the basis of segment reporting. This reassessment 
was necessitated by the change in business strategy over the period, increased interdependency between various service 
lines, increased fungibility of resources/common cost, change in the way Board of Directors (Chief Operating Decision Maker 
“CODM”) review Company performance etc. Earlier, the Company disclosed four reportable segments that were Payment, 
Commerce, Cloud and others. 
In line with the above shift in business strategy and the consequent change in the way the CODM reviews the performance, 
management of the Company has aligned segment disclosure to the above change. Further, it has been concluded that 
though there are different business units of the Company, including Payment and Financial services, Commerce and cloud 
services, information reviewed by the CODM is at the revenue level and the Company does not allocate operating costs and 
expenses, assets and liabilities across business units, as the CODM does not use such information to allocate resources or 
evaluate the performance of the business units. Allocation of resources and assessment of financial performance is done at 
the consolidated level.
Accordingly, it has been assessed that Company operates in a single Operating as well as Reportable Segment. 
The Company has revenues primarily from customers domiciled in India. Substantially all of the Company’s non-current 
operating assets are domiciled in India.
Information about major customers
Revenue of H 6,379 are derived from one external customer (March 31, 2021: H 8,628 from one external customers).

Key audit matter 
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Assessment 
of 
impairment 
of 
goodwill 
relating 
to acquisition of subsidiaries and assessment of 
appropriateness of the carrying value of investments in 
associates
(Refer accompanying notes 2.2, 2.4, 2.5(j), 2.5(n), 
2.5(u), 4, 5(b), 20 and 36 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements)
The Group performed an impairment assessment over 
the goodwill balance by calculating the recoverable 
value of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the 
Goodwill belongs using a discounted cash flow model 
and comparing the same with the carrying value. For the 
purpose of impairment assessment, each subsidiary is 
considered as separate CGU.
Our procedures to assess impairment of goodwill relating 
to acquisition of subsidiaries and appropriateness of the 
assessment of carrying value of investments in associates 
included the following:
•	
We obtained an understanding from the management, 
assessed and tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of the Company’s key controls over the 
impairment and valuation assessment.
The management has estimated future cash flows for 
a 5 year period and a terminal growth rate is applied in 
determining the terminal value.
Further, there are certain investments in associates which 
are carried at cost (subject to impairment assessment).
We considered impairment assessment of goodwill and 
carrying value of associate’s investment as key audit 
matter given the extent of management judgement and 
the estimates involved around impairment assessment 
with respect to determining appropriate discount rates, 
cash flow projections (Cash flow forecasts) and earnings 
growth rates applied beyond the initial five-year period 
(Terminal growth rates).
•	
We evaluated the Company’s process regarding 
impairment and carrying value assessment by involving 
auditor’s valuation experts to assist in assessing the 
appropriateness of the valuation and impairment 
model including the independent assessment of the 
underlying assumptions relating to cash flow, discount 
rate, terminal value, etc. for material investments.
•	
We checked the mathematical accuracy of the valuation 
and impairment model and agreed relevant data back 
to the latest budgets, actual past results and other 
supporting documents.
•	
We assessed the Company’s sensitivity analysis and 
evaluated whether any reasonably foreseeable change 
in assumptions could lead to impairment or material 
change in the carrying value.
•	
We assessed adequacy of relevant disclosures in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Based on the above audit procedures performed, the 
Management’s assessment of the impairment of goodwill 
on acquisition of subsidiaries and carrying value of the 
investments in associates was considered to be reasonable.
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In 
connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If, based on the work we have 
performed and the reports of the other auditors 
as furnished to us (Refer paragraph 17 below), we 
Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.  
Other Information

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible

We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Those 
Charged With Governance for the Consolidated 
Financial Statements 
9.	
The 
Holding 
Company’s 
Board 
of 
Directors 
is 
responsible for the preparation and presentation of 
these Consolidated Financial Statements in term of the 
requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view 
of the consolidated financial position, consolidated 
financial performance and consolidated cash flows, 
and changes in equity of the Group including its 
associate companies and joint ventures in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Accounting Standards specified 
under Section 133 of the Act. The respective Board 
of Directors of the companies included in the Group 
and of its associate companies and joint ventures are 
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements  that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of 
preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
10.	 In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 
respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and of its associate companies and  joint 
ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of 
the Group and of its associate companies and joint 
ventures to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Group or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to 
do so.
11.	 The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group and of its associate companies 
and joint ventures are responsible for overseeing the 
financial reporting process of the Group and of its 
associate companies and joint ventures.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
12.	 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these Consolidated Financial Statements.
13.	 As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	
•	
Identify 
and 
assess 
the 
risks 
of 
material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
	
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that 
are 
appropriate 
in 
the 
circumstances. 
Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also 
responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the Holding company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
	
•	
Evaluate 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made  
by management.
	
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
ability of the Group and its associate companies 
and joint ventures to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group and its 
associate companies and joint ventures to cease to 
continue as a going concern. 
172
Independent 
Auditor’s 
Report

File: annual_report_22, Page number: 192
	
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
Consolidated Financial Statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation. 
	
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the entities 
or business activities within the Group and 
its associate companies and joint ventures to 
express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of the 
financial statements of such entities included in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we 
are the independent auditors. For the other entities 
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
which have been audited by other auditors, such 
other auditors remain responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audits carried 
out by them. We remain solely responsible for our 
audit opinion.
14.	 We communicate with those charged with governance 
of the Holding Company and such other entities 
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements 
of which we are the independent auditors regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
15.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable,  
related safeguards.
16.	 From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that were 
of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
Other Matters
17.	 We did not audit the financial statements/financial 
information 
of 
13 
subsidiaries 
whose 
financial

The respective Board of Directors of the Holding 
Company, its subsidiary companies, its associate 
companies and joint venture, to whom reporting under 
clause (i) of sub section 3 of Section 143 of the Act 
in respect of the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements is 
applicable, which are companies incorporated in 
India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls based on internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (“the 
Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (“ICAI”).  These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to the respective 
company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note issued 
by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing deemed to 
be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies 
Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that we 
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all  
material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls system with reference to financial 
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors 
in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters 
paragraph below is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the Holding Company’s 
internal financial controls system with reference to 
consolidated financial statements.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to financial statements
6.	
A company’s internal financial control with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial control with reference to financial 
statements includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent 
Limitations 
of 
Internal 
Financial 
Controls with reference to financial statements
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements to future 
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
control with reference to financial statements may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, 
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Holding Company, its subsidiary 
companies, its associate companies and joint venture, 
which are companies incorporated in India, have, in 
all material respects, an adequate internal financial 
controls system with reference to financial statements 
and such internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements were operating effectively as at 
March 31, 2022, based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. Also 
refer paragraph 4 (a), 5 and 6 of our main audit report.
Other Matters
9.	
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on 
the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
insofar as it relates to 8 subsidiary companies and 4 
associate companies, which are companies incorporated 
in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the 
auditors of such companies incorporated in India. Our 
opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

2.	 Significant accounting policies
2.1	Basis of preparation
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group 
have been prepared in accordance with Indian 
Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) prescribed under 
Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and other relevant 
provisions of the Act as amended from time to time.
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been 
prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain 
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
(refer accounting policies on financial instruments and 
Share-based payments).
	
Accounting policies have been consistently applied 
except where a newly issued accounting standard is 
initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting 
standard requires a change in the accounting policy 
hitherto in use.
	
The Group has applied the following amendments for 
the first time for year commencing from April 1, 2021:
	
•	
Interest rate benchmark reform – amendments 
to Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments, Ind AS 107, 
Financial Instruments: Disclosures, Ind AS 104, 
Insurance Contracts and Ind AS 116, Leases
	
•	
Extension of COVID-19 related concessions – 
amendments to Ind AS 116
	
The amendments listed above did not have any impact 
on the amounts recognised in prior periods and are 
not expected to significantly affect the current or  
future periods.
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) through a 
notification dated March 24, 2021, amended Division 
II of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013. These 
amendments are applicable for the reporting year 
beginning on or after April 1, 2021. Pursuant to these 
amendment, the comparative figures as disclosed in 
these Consolidated Financial Statements have been 
regrouped/reclassified, wherever necessary, to make 
them comparable to current year figures. The impact of 
such classifications is summarised below:

Title 
Key requirements
Ind AS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment
Proceeds before intended use of property, plant and equipment:
The amendment clarifies that an entity shall deduct from the cost of an 
item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds received from selling 
items produced while the entity is preparing the asset for its intended use 
(for example, the proceeds from selling samples produced when testing a 
machine to see if it is functioning properly).
Ind AS 37, Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets
Onerous Contracts – Cost of fulfilling a contract:
The amendment explains that the cost of fulfilling a contract comprises: 
the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract and an allocation of other 
costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts.
Ind AS 103, Business combinations
References to the conceptual framework:
The amendment adds a new exception in Ind AS 103 for liabilities and 
contingent liabilities.
Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments
Fees included in the 10% test for derecognition of financial liabilities:
The amendment clarifies which fees an entity includes when it applies the 
‘10%’ test in assessing whether to derecognise a financial liability. An entity 
includes only fees paid or received between the entity (the borrower) 
and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the entity or the 
lender on the other’s behalf.
Ind AS 101, First time adoption
Subsidiary as a first-time adopter:
Simplifies the application of Ind AS 101 by a subsidiary that becomes 
a first-time adopter after its parent in relation to the measurement of 
cumulative translation differences.
Ind AS 41, Agriculture
Taxation in fair value measurements:
The amendment removes the requirement in Ind AS 41 for entities to 
exclude cash flows for taxation when measuring fair value. This aligns the 
fair value measurement in Ind AS 41 with the requirements of Ind AS 113, 
Fair Value Measurement.
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has vide notification dated March 23, 2022 notified Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022 which amends certain accounting standards, and are effective form April 1, 2022. 
Below is a summary of such amendments:
	
These amendments are not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group in the current or future reporting 
periods and on foreseeable future transactions.
	
The Code on Social Security,2020 (‘Code’) relating 
to employee benefits during employment and post 
employment benefits received Presidential assent in 
September 2020. The Code has been published in the 
Gazette of India. However,the date on which the Code 
will come into effect has not been notified.The Group 
will assess the impact of the Code when it comes into 
effect and will record any related impact in the period 
the Code becomes effective.
	
All the amounts included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements are presented in Indian Rupees (‘Rupees’ or 
‘Rs.’ or ‘INR’) and are rounded to the nearest millions, 
except per share data and unless stated otherwise.
 
Impact of COVID-19
	
COVID-19 continues to spread across globe and India. 
This has impact on all local and global economic 
activities. Government of India has taken series of 
measures to contain spread of virus and limit economic 
impact on corporates and individuals. 
	
The Group has considered the possible effects that may 
result from COVID-19, on the carrying amount of the 
receivables, investments, goodwill etc. While making 
the assessment the Group has taken cognizance of 
internal and external information up to the date of 
approval of these Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Group based on current estimates expects the 
carrying amount of the above assets will be recovered.

Management believes that it has taken into account 
all the possible impact of known events arising 
from COVID-19 pandemic in the preparation of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the 
impact assessment of COVID-19 is a continuing process 
given the uncertainties associated with its nature 
and duration. The Group will continue to monitor any 
material changes to the future economic conditions.
2.2	Business Combination and Goodwill
	
Business combinations (other than those under 
common control) are accounted for using the acquisition 
method under Ind AS 103. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date fair value. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
	
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired 
and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their 
acquisition date fair values. However, the following 
assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination 
are measured at the basis indicated below: 
	
•	
The assets or liabilities related to employee benefit 
arrangements are recognised and measured in 
accordance with Ind AS 19 Employee Benefits.
	
•	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
and measured in accordance with Ind AS 12 
Income Taxes.
	
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the 
financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate 
classification and designation in accordance with 
the contractual terms, economic circumstances and 
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. The 
consideration transferred by the acquirer is recognized 
at fair value at the acquisition date. Deferred 
consideration is classified as a liability under Ind AS 109 
and is measured at amortized cost.
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of 
the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the 
net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is 
tested for impairment annually or more frequently if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that they 
might be impaired.
	
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired 
in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, 
allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units 
that are expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the 
acquiree are assigned to those units.
	
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been 
allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit 
may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit 
and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based 
on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any 
impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in statement 
of profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
2.3	Basis of consolidation
	
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) 
over which the Group has Control. The determination 
of control for the purpose of consolidation is done as 
per Ind AS 110. Control is achieved when the Group 
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power over the investee.
	
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only 
if the Group has:
	
a)	
Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that 
give it the current ability to direct the relevant 
activities of the investee)
	
b)	 Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee, and
	
c)	
The ability to use its power over the investee to 
affect its returns
	
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting 
rights result in control. To support this presumption and 
when the Group has less than a majority of the voting 
or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all 
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether 
it has power over an investee, including:
	
a)	
The contractual arrangement with the other vote 
holders of the investee
	
b)	 Rights arising from other contractual arrangements
	
c)	
The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
	
d)	 The size of the group’s holding of voting rights 
relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings 
of the other voting rights holders
	
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an 
investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there 
are changes to one or more of the three elements of 
control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when 
190
Notes to the

Annual Report

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and 
ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. 
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date 
the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases 
to control the subsidiary. 
	
Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using 
uniform accounting policies for like transactions and 
other events in similar circumstances. If a member of 
the group uses accounting policies other than those 
adopted in the Consolidated Financial Statements for 
like transactions and events in similar circumstances, 
appropriate adjustments are made to that group 
member’s Financial Statements in preparing the 
Consolidated Financial Statements to ensure conformity 
with the group’s accounting policies.
	
The Financial Statements of all entities used for 
the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same 
reporting date as that of the Group. When the end of the 
reporting period of the parent is different from that of 
a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation 
purposes, additional financial information as of the same 
date as the consolidated financial statements of the 
parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial 
information of the subsidiary, unless it is impracticable 
to do so.
 
Consolidation procedures:
	
(a)	 Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with 
those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income 
and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the 
amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements at the 
acquisition date.
	
(b)	 Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the 
parent’s investment in each subsidiary and the 
parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary. 
	
(c)	 Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to 
transactions between entities of the group (profits 
or losses resulting from intragroup transactions 
that are recognised in Fixed assets, such as 
inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated in full). 
Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment 
that requires recognition in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Ind AS12 Income Taxes 
applies to temporary differences that arise from 
the elimination of profits and losses resulting from 
intragroup transactions.
	
Profit 
or 
loss 
and 
each 
component 
of 
other 
comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the 
equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the 
non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-
controlling interests having a deficit balance. When 
necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting 
policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. 
All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, 
expenses and cash flows relating to transactions 
between members of the Group are eliminated in full 
on consolidation. The Group measures non-controlling 
interests at their proportion of the fair value of the 
identifiable net assets. 
2.4	Investment in associates and joint ventures
	
An associate is an entity over which the Group has 
significant influence. Significant influence is the 
power to participate in the financial and operating 
policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or  
joint control.
	
The considerations made in determining whether 
significant influence is similar to those necessary to 
determine control over the Subsidiaries.
	
The Group’s investments in its associate are accounted for 
using the equity method. Under the equity method, the 
investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. 
	
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the 
equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in 
the consolidated balance sheet. 
	
The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to 	
recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets 
of the associate or joint venture since the acquisition 
date. Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture 
is included in the carrying amount of the investment 
and is not tested for impairment individually.
	
The consolidated statement of profit and loss reflects 
the Group’s share of the results of operations of the 
associate or joint venture. Any change in OCI of the 
associate or joint venture is presented as part of the 
Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a change 
recognised directly in the equity of the associate or 
joint venture, the Group recognises its share of any 
changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes 
in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from 
transactions between the Group and the associate or 
joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest 
in the associate or joint venture.
	
If an entity’s share of losses of an associate or joint 
venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or 
191
Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Annual Report 
2022

File: annual_report_22, Page number: 211
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
joint venture (which includes any long term interest that, 
in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in 
the associate), the entity discontinues recognising its 
share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised 
only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf 
of the associate or joint venture. If the associate or 
joint venture subsequently reports profits, the entity 
resumes recognising its share of those profits only 
after its share of the profits equals the share of losses  
not recognised.
	
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of 
an associate or joint venture is shown on the face of the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss. The financial 
statements of the associate are prepared for the 
same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, 
adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies 
in line with those of the Group. 
	
After application of the equity method, the Group 
determines whether it is necessary to recognise an 
impairment loss on its investment in its associate or joint 
venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines 
whether there is objective evidence that the investment 
in the associate or joint venture is impaired.
	
 If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the 
amount of impairment as the difference between the 
recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture 
and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss 
as ‘exceptional items’ in the consolidated statement of 
profit or loss.
	
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, 
the Group measures and recognises any retained 
investment at its fair value. Any difference between 
the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of 
significant influence and the fair value of the retained 
investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in 
consolidated statement of profit or loss.
2.5	Summary of significant accounting policies
 
a. 
Current versus non-current classification
	
	
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the 
consolidated balance sheet based on current / 
non-current classification. 
	
	
An asset is classified as current when it is expected 
to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed 
in normal operating cycle, held primarily for the 
purpose of trading, expected to be realised within 
twelve months after the reporting period, or cash 
or cash equivalent unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period. All other 
assets are classified as non-current.
	
	
A liability is classified as current when it is expected 
to be settled in normal operating cycle, it is held 
primarily for the purpose of trading, it is due to be 
settled within twelve months after the reporting 
period, or there is no unconditional right to defer 
the settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period. The Group 
classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities, are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities.
	
	
The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The Group 
has identified twelve months as its operating cycle. 
 
b. 
Foreign currencies
	
	
Functional and presentation currency
	
	
Items included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Group are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment 
in which it operates i.e. the “functional currency”. 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements 
are presented in INR, which is also the Holding 
Company’s functional currency.
	
	
Transactions and balances
	
	
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially 
recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective 
functional currency at exchange rates prevailing 
at 
the 
date 
the 
transaction 
first 
qualifies  
for recognition.
	
	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated at the functional 
currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting 
date. Exchange differences arising on settlement 
or translation of monetary items are recognised in 
profit or loss.
	
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the dates of the  
initial transactions. 
	
	
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the date when the fair value is determined. 
The gain or loss arising on translation of non-
monetary items measured at fair value is treated 
in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on 
192
Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Annual Report 
2022

File: annual_report_22, Page number: 212
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation 
differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is 
recognised in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) 
or consolidated statement of profit and loss, are 
also recognised in OCI or consolidated statement 
of profit and loss, respectively).
 
 
Group companies
	
	
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign 
operations are translated into INR at the rate of 
exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their 
consolidated statements of profit and loss are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates 
of the transactions. The exchange differences arising 
on translation for consolidation are recognised in OCI. 
On disposal of a foreign operation, the component 
of OCI relating to that particular foreign operation is 
recognised in profit or loss.
 
c. 
Fair value measurement
	
	
The Group measures certain financial instruments 
(e.g. investments) at fair value at each balance 
sheet date. 
	
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. 
	
	
The fair value measurement is based on the 
presumption that the transaction to sell the 
asset or transfer the liabilities takes place either 
in the principal market for the asset or liability 
or in absence of principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability.
	
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.
	
	
The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
	
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial 
statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
	
	
Level 1- Quoted (Unadjusted) marked prices in the 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
	
Level 2- Valuation techniques for which the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable
	
	
Level 3- Valuation techniques for which the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable.
	
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements on a recurring 
basis, the Group determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy 
by re-assessing categorisation (based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
	
At each reporting date, the management analyses 
the movements in the values of assets and 
liabilities which are required to be re-measured 
or re-assessed as per the Group’s accounting 
policies. For this analysis, the management or 
its expert verifies the major inputs applied in the 
latest valuation by agreeing the information in 
the valuation computation to contracts and other 
relevant documents.
	
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on 
the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of 
the asset or liability and the level of the fair value 
hierarchy as explained above.
 
d. 
Revenue recognition
	
	
Revenue is measured based on the consideration 
specified in a contract with a customer net of 
variable consideration e.g. discounts, volume 
rebates, any payments made to a customer (unless 
the payment is for a distinct good or service 
received from the customer) and excludes amounts 
collected on behalf of third parties. The Group 
recognises revenue when it transfers control over 
a product or service to a customer. Revenue is only 
recognised to the extent that it is highly probable 
that a significant reversal will not occur.
	
	
The Group provides incentives to its users in various 
forms including cashbacks. Incentives which are 
consideration payable to the customer that are 
not in exchange for a distinct good or service are 
generally recognized as a reduction of revenue.
	
	
Where the Group acts as an agent for selling goods 
or services, only the commission income is included

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
within revenue. The specific revenue recognition 
criteria described below must also be met before 
revenue is recognized. Typically, the Group has a 
right to payment before or at the point that services 
are delivered. Cash received before the services 
are delivered is recognised as a contract liability. 
The amount of consideration does not contain a 
significant financing component as payment terms 
are less than one year. 
 
 
Sale of services 
	
	
Revenue from services is recognized when the 
control in services is transferred as per the terms 
of the agreement with customer i.e. as and when 
services are rendered. Revenues are disclosed 
net of the Goods and Services Tax charged on 
such services. In terms of the contract, excess of 
revenue over the billed at the year-end is carried in 
the balance sheet as trade receivables where the 
amount is recoverable from the customer without 
any future performance obligation and the Group 
has unconditional right over such consideration 
(i.e. if only the passage of time is required before 
payment of such consideration is due). Cash 
received before the services are delivered is 
recognised as a contract liability.
 
 
Commission
	
	
The Group facilitates recharge of talk time, bill 
payments, availability of bus tickets and sale of deal 
coupons and earns commission for the respective 
services. 
Commission 
income 
is 
recognized 
when the control in services is transferred to the 
customer when the services have been provided 
by the Group.
 
 
Service fees from merchants
	
	
The Group earns service fee from merchants and 
recognizes such revenue when the control in 
services have been transferred by the Group i.e. 
as and when services have been provided by the 
Group. Such service fee is generally determined 
as a percentage of transaction value executed 
by the merchants. Amount received by the Group 
pending settlement are disclosed as payable to the 
merchants under other financial liabilities.
 
 
Revenue from broking activities
	
	
Revenue from broking activities, fees and delayed 
payment charges is recognized on the trade date 
of transaction (net of Goods & service tax (GST), 
securities transaction tax, stamp duties and other 
levies by SEBI and stock exchanges). Revenue 
from platform fees are received periodically but are 
recognized as earned on pro-rata basis over the 
term of the contract i.e. one year.
 
 
Government Grants
	
	
The Group recognises government grants only 
when there is reasonable assurance that the 
conditions attached to them will be complied with, 
and the grants will be received. Government grants 
related to revenue are recognized on a systematic 
basis in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss as other operating revenue over the periods 
necessary to match them with the related costs, if 
any, which they are intended to compensate.
 
 
Interest income
	
	
For all debt instruments measured either at 
amortised cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, interest income is recorded 
using the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the 
rate that exactly discounts the estimated future 
cash payments or receipts over the expected life 
of the financial instrument or a shorter period, 
where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount 
of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of 
a financial liability. When calculating the effective 
interest rate, the Group estimates the expected 
cash flows by considering all the contractual terms 
of the financial instrument but does not consider 
the expected credit losses. Interest income is 
included in other income in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss.
 
e. 
Taxes
 
 
Current income tax
	
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax 
rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are 
those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at 
the reporting date in the countries where the Group 
operates and generates taxable income.
	
	
Current income tax relating to items recognised 
outside consolidated statement of profit and loss is 
recognised either in other comprehensive income or in 
equity. Current tax items are recognised in correlation 
to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly 
in equity. Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in the tax returns with respect to 
situations in which applicable tax regulations are 
subject to interpretation and considers whether 
194
Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
it is probable that a taxation authority will accept 
an uncertain tax treatment. The Group measures 
its tax balances either based on the most likely 
amount or the expected value, depending on 
which method provides a better prediction of the 
resolution of the uncertainty.
 
 
Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method 
on temporary differences between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for 
financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except:
	
	
•	
When the deferred tax liability arises from the 
initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit or loss.
	
	
•	
In respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint ventures, when 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is probable 
that the temporary differences will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, the carry forward of unused 
tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences, 
and the carry forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses can be utilised, The carrying 
amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
reporting date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit 
will be available to allow all or part of the deferred 
tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax 
assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and 
are recognised to the extent that it has become 
probable that future taxable profits will allow the 
deferred tax asset to be recovered.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are not recognised for temporary 
differences between the carrying amount and tax 
bases of investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and interest in joint arrangements where it is not 
probable that the differences will reverse in the 
foreseeable future and taxable profit will not be 
available against which the temporary difference 
can be utilised.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based 
on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside 
consolidated statement of profit and loss is 
recognised either in other comprehensive income 
or in equity. Deferred tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in 
OCI or directly in equity.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are 
offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity 
and the same taxation authority.
 
 
Minimum alternate tax
	
	
Credit of MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset 
only when it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the credit can be utilised. In 
the year in which the MAT credit becomes eligible 
to be recognised as an asset, the said asset is 
created by way of a credit to the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss account. The Group 
reviews the same at each balance sheet date and 
writes down the carrying amount of MAT credit 
entitlement to the extent it is no longer probable 
that the Group will pay normal income tax during 
the specified period.
 
 
Taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring 
expenses
	
	
Assets are recognised net of the amount of GST 
paid, except when the tax incurred on a purchase 
of assets is not recoverable from the taxation 
authority, in which case, the tax paid is recognised 
as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset.
	
	
Expenses are recognised net of the amount of GST 
paid, except when the tax incurred on a purchase 
of services is not recoverable from the taxation 
authority, in which case, the tax paid is expensed 
off in statement of profit and loss.
	
	
The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable 
to, the taxation authority is included as part of 
other current/ non- current assets or other current 
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

f. 
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations
	
	
The Group classifies non-current assets and 
disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying 
amounts will be recovered principally through a 
sale rather than through continuing use. Actions 
required to complete the sale should indicate that 
it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale 
will be made or that the decision to sell will be 
withdrawn. Management must be committed to 
the sale expected within one year from the date  
of classification.
	
	
For these purposes, sale transactions include 
exchanges of non-current assets for other 
non-current assets when the exchange has 
commercial substance. The criteria for held for sale 
classification is regarded met only when the assets 
or disposal group is available for immediate sale in 
its present condition, subject only to terms that are 
usual and customary for sales of such assets (or 
disposal groups), its sale is highly probable; and it 
will genuinely be sold, not abandoned. The Group 
treats sale of the asset or disposal group to be 
highly probable when:
	
	
•	
The appropriate level of management is 
committed to a plan to sell the asset (or 
disposal group),
	
	
•	
An active programme to locate a buyer and 
complete the plan has been initiated (if 
applicable),
	
	
•	
The asset (or disposal group) is being actively 
marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable 
in relation to its current fair value,
	
	
•	
The sale is expected to qualify for recognition 
as a completed sale within one year from the 
date of classification , and
	
	
•	
Actions required to complete the plan indicate 
that it is unlikely that significant changes to 
the plan will be made or that the plan will be 
withdrawn.
	
	
Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups 
are measured at the lower of their carrying amount 
and the fair value less costs to sell. Assets and 
liabilities classified as held for sale are presented 
separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
	
	
Property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets once classified as held for sale are not 
depreciated or amortised.
	
	
A disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation 
if it is a component of an entity that either has been 
disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and:
	
	
•	
Represents a separate major line of business 
or geographical area of operations or
	
	
•	
Is part of a single co-ordinated plan to 
dispose of a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations.
	
	
Discontinued operations are excluded from the 
results of continuing operations and are presented 
as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from 
discontinued 
operations 
in 
the 
consolidated 
statement of profit and loss.
 
g. 
Property, plant and equipment
	
	
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment, if any. Property, plant and equipment 
is depreciated on a written down value basis to its 
residual value over its estimated useful life.
	
	
Cost directly attributable to acquisition are 
capitalised until the property, plant and equipment 
are ready for use, as intended by the management. 
	
	
Subsequent costs are capitalised on the carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when future economic benefits 
associated with the item are probable to flow to 
the Group and cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. When significant parts of property, plant 
and equipment are required to be replaced at 
intervals, the Group depreciates them separately 
based on their specific useful lives. The carrying 
amount of any component accounted for as a 
separate asset is derecognised when replaced. 
All repair and maintenance are charged to 
consolidated statement of profit and loss during 
the reporting period in which they are incurred.
	
	
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, 
plant and equipment outstanding at each balance 
sheet date is classified as capital advances under 
the non-current assets and the cost of assets not 
ready to use before such date are disclosed under 
‘Capital work in progress’.
	
	
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement 
of an item of property, plant and equipment is 
determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
and is recognised in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss on the date of disposal or retirement.

Depreciation is provided using the written down 
value method and charged to consolidated 
statement of profit and loss as per the rates 
prescribed under schedule II of the Companies 
Act, 2013 except for technical evaluation done by 
the management’s expert for plant and machinery, 
given below:
Assets

Office equipment
45.07%
Furniture and fittings
25.89%
Plant & Machinery
45.07% / 63.16%
Vehicles
31.23%
	
	
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the 
shorter of their useful life or the lease term, unless 
the entity expects to use the assets beyond the 
lease term.
	
	
The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
 
h. 
Intangible assets
	
	
Separately acquired intangible assets, such as 
software are measured initially at cost. Following 
initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at 
cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. Internally generated 
intangible assets, excluding capitalized development 
costs, are not capitalized and expenditure is reflected 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the 
year in which the expenditure is incurred. Intangible 
assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost and 
are amortised on a written down value basis over their 
estimated useful lives and charged to consolidated 
statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Software and licenses acquired are amortized at 
the rate of 40% per annum on written down value 
method. Other intangibles i.e Customer relationship, 
right to use brand and non- compete right acquired 
in business combination are amortised over their 
useful life on straight line basis, which is taken to 
be 5 years.
	
	
The amortization period and the amortization 
method are reviewed at least at each financial 
year end. Changes in the expected useful life or 
the expected pattern of consumption of future 
economic benefits embodied in the asset are 
considered to modify the amortisation period 
or method, as appropriate, and are treated as 
changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation 
expense on intangible assets is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss unless 
such expenditure forms part of carrying value of 
another asset.
	
	
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an 
intangible asset are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss when 
the asset is derecognized.
 
 
Research and development costs
	
	
Research 
costs 
are 
expensed 
as 
incurred. 
Development expenditure incurred on an individual 
project is recognized as an intangible asset when 
the Group can demonstrate all the following:
	
	
•	
The technical feasibility of completing the 
intangible asset so that it will be available for 
use or sale
	
	
•	
Its intention to complete the asset
	
	
•	
Its ability to use or sell the asset
	
	
•	
How the asset will generate future economic 
benefits
	
	
•	
The availability of adequate resources to 
complete the development and to use or sell 
the asset
	
	
•	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure 
attributable to the intangible asset during 
development.
	
	
Following the initial recognition of the development 
expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied 
requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any 
accumulated 
amortization 
and 
accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortization of the asset begins 
when development is complete and the asset is 
available for use. It is amortized on a straight line 
basis over the period of expected future benefit 
from the related project, i.e., the estimated useful 
life of one to five years. Amortization is recognized 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. 
During the period of development, the asset is 
tested for impairment annually.

i. 
Borrowing costs
	
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of an asset 
that necessarily takes a substantial period of 
time to get ready for its intended use or sale are 
capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other 
borrowing costs are expensed in the period in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss in which 
they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and 
other costs that an entity incurs in connection with 
the borrowing of funds. 
 
j. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
	
For all non-financial assets, the Group assesses 
whether there are indicators of impairment. If such 
an indicator exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are independent from 
other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which 
the asset belongs. 
	
	
The recoverable amount for an asset or CGU is the 
higher of its value in use and fair value less costs 
of disposal. If the recoverable amount of an asset 
or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount or CGU the asset is considered impaired 
and the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss. 
	
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows of the asset or CGU are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In 
determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent 
market transactions are taken into account. If no 
such transactions can be identified, an appropriate 
valuation model is used. These calculations are 
corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share 
prices for publicly traded companies or other 
available fair value indicators.
	
	
The Group bases its impairment calculation on 
detailed budgets and forecast calculations. These 
budgets and forecast calculations generally cover 
a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-
term growth rate is calculated and applied to 
project future cash flows after the fifth year. To 
estimate cash flow projections beyond periods 
covered by the most recent budgets/forecasts, 
the Group extrapolates cash flow projections in 
the budget using a steady or declining growth rate 
for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate 
can be justified. In any case, this growth rate does 
not exceed the long-term average growth rate for 
the products, industries, or country or countries 
in which the entity operates, or for the market in 
which the asset is used.
	
	
An assessment is made at each reporting date 
to determine whether there is an indication that 
previously 
recognised 
impairment 
losses 
no 
longer exist or have decreased. If such indication 
exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount. A previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been 
a change in the assumptions used to determine 
the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount since the 
last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal 
is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset 
does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
Such reversal is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss. 
 
k. 
Provisions and contingencies
 
 
Provisions
	
	
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a 
present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result 
of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. When the Group expects some or all of 
a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement 
is recognised as a separate asset, but only 
when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The 
expense relating to a provision is presented in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss net of 
any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value 
of money is material, provisions are discounted 
using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When 
discounting is used, the increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognised as a 
finance cost.
 
 
Contingencies
	
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that 
arises from past events whose existence will be 
confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence 
of one or more uncertain future events beyond the 
control of the Group or a present obligation that 
198
Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Annual Report 
2022

File: annual_report_22, Page number: 218
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
is not recognized because it is not probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle 
the obligation. A contingent liability also arises 
in extremely rare cases where there is a liability 
that cannot be recognized because it cannot be 
measured reliably. The Group does not recognize a 
contingent liability but discloses its existence in the 
consolidated financial Statements.
 
l. 
Retirement and other employee benefits
	
	
For defined benefit plans (gratuity), the liability 
or asset recognised in the balance sheet is the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation at 
the end of the reporting period less the fair value 
of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is 
calculated by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. 
	
	
The present value of the defined benefit obligation 
is determined by discounting the estimated future 
cash outflows by reference to market yields at the 
end of the reporting period on government bonds 
that have terms approximating to the terms of the 
related obligation.
	
	
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the 
discount rate to the net balance of the defined 
benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. 
This cost is included in employee benefit expense 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from 
experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are recognised in the period in which 
they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. 
They are included in retained earnings in the 
statement of changes in equity and in the balance 
sheet. Re-measurements are not reclassified to 
profit or loss in subsequent periods.
	
	
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation resulting from plan amendments or 
curtailments are recognised immediately in profit 
or loss as past service cost.
	
	
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution 
plans (provident fund) are recognized in profit or 
loss when the employee renders related service. 
The Group has no further obligations under these 
plans beyond its periodic contributions.
	
	
The Group provides for liability at year end on 
account of un-availed earned leave as per actuarial 
valuation using projected unit credit method.
	
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-
monetary benefits that are expected to be settled 
wholly within 12 months after the end of the period 
in which the employees render the related service 
are recognised in respect of employees’ services up 
to the end of the reporting period and are measured 
at the amounts expected to be paid when the 
liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented 
as employee benefit payable under other financial 
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
 
m. Share-based payments
 
 
i) 
Equity-settled transactions
	
	
	
Employees (including senior executives) of 
the Group receive remuneration in the form of 
share-based payments, whereby employees 
render services as consideration for equity 
instruments (equity-settled transactions).
	
	
	
The cost of equity-settled transactions is 
determined by the fair value at the date 
when the grant is made using an appropriate 
valuation model.
	
	
	
That cost is recognised, together with a 
corresponding increase in Employee Stock 
Option Plan (ESOP) reserves in equity, over 
the period in which the performance and/or 
service conditions are fulfilled in employee 
benefits expense. The cumulative expense 
recognised for equity-settled transactions 
at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and the Group’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The consolidated statement 
of profit and loss expense or credit for a 
period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning 
and end of that period and is recognised in 
employee benefits expense.
	
	
	
Performance conditions which are market 
conditions are taken into account when 
determining the grant date fair value of the 
awards. Service and non-market performance 
conditions are not taken into account when 
determining the grant date fair value of awards, 
but the likelihood of the conditions being met is 
assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest.
	
	
	
No expense is recognised for awards that 
do not ultimately vest because non-market 
performance and/or service conditions have 
not been met.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
	
When the terms of an equity-settled award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised is 
the expense had the terms not been modified, 
if the original terms of the award are met. 
An additional expense is recognised for any 
modification that increases the total fair value 
of the share-based payment transaction, or 
is otherwise beneficial to the employee as 
measured at the date of modification. 
	
	
	
Where an award is cancelled by the entity or 
by the counterparty, any remaining element 
of the fair value of the award is expensed 
immediately through profit or loss.
	
	
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is 
reflected as additional share dilution in the 
computation of diluted earnings per share.
 
 
ii) 
Cash-settled transactions
	
	
	
For awards classified as cash settled share 
based transactions, the goods or services 
acquired are measured and the liability 
incurred, at the fair value of liability. Until the 
liability is settled, the fair value of the liability 
is re-measured at the end of each reporting 
period and at the date of settlement, with any 
changes in fair value recognised in consolidated 
statement of profit and loss for the period.
	
	
	
The 
cost 
of 
cash-settled 
transactions 
is determined by the fair value of equity 
instruments at each reporting date using an 
appropriate valuation model.
	
	
	
That cost is recognised, together with a 
corresponding increase in liability, over the 
period in which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits 
expense. The cumulative expense recognised 
for cash-settled transactions at each reporting 
date until the vesting date reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired and 
the Group’s best estimate of the number of 
equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The consolidated statement of profit and loss 
expense or credit for a period represents the 
movement in cumulative expense recognised 
as at the beginning and end of that period and 
is recognised in employee benefits expense.
	
	
	
No expense is recognised for awards that 
do not ultimately vest because non-market 
performance and/or service conditions have 
not been met.
	
	
	
The Group has set up Paytm Associate Benefit 
Welfare Trust (formerly known as One 97 
Employee Welfare Trust) for administering 
certain 
types 
of 
share-based 
payment 
arrangements including awards given to 
employees of the outside group companies as 
well for awards of options of other companies 
given to its employees. The Group uses the 
Trust as a vehicle for distributing shares under 
the ESOP schemes. The Trust holds shares 
of the Group, for giving shares to employees. 
The Group treats the Trust as its extension and 
shares of the Group held by Trust are treated 
as treasury shares. Other assets held by the 
Trust are consolidated on a line-by-line basis 
with Group’s consolidated financial statements. 
Shares of other companies held by the Trust 
for distribution to its employees are separately 
disclosed under investments.
	
	
	
The Group has lost control over the Trust 
and accordingly, it is now not consolidated 
on 
a 
line-by-line 
basis 
with 
Group’s  
financial statements. 
 
n. 
Financial instruments
	
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives 
rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial 
liability or equity instrument of another entity.
 
 
Financial assets
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
All financial assets are recognised initially at 
fair value plus, in the case of financial assets 
not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, 
transaction costs that are attributable to the 
acquisition of the financial asset.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
For 
purposes 
of 
subsequent 
measurement, 
financial assets are classified in four categories:
	
	
•	
Debt instruments at amortized cost
	
	
•	
Debt instruments at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
	
	
•	
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity 
instruments at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL)
	
	
•	
Equity instruments measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)

Debt instruments at amortised cost
	
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised 
cost if both the following conditions are met:
	
	
a)	
The asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold assets for collecting 
contractual cash flows, and
	
	
b)	 Contractual terms of the asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on 
the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost 
is calculated by taking into account any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization 
is included in finance income in the profit or loss. 
The losses arising from impairment are recognised 
in the profit or loss. This category generally applies 
to trade and other receivables and is most relevant 
to the Group.
	
	
Debt instrument at FVTOCI
	
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if 
both of the following criteria are met:
	
	
a)	
The objective of the business model is 
achieved both by collecting contractual cash 
flows and selling the financial assets,   and
	
	
b)	 The asset’s contractual cash flows represent 
SPPI.
	
	
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI 
category are measured initially as well as at each 
reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements 
are recognized in the other comprehensive income 
(OCI). However, the Group recognizes interest 
income, impairment losses and reversals and 
foreign exchange gain or loss in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss. On derecognition 
of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to 
consolidated statement of profit and loss. Interest 
earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is 
reported as interest income using the EIR method.
	
	
Debt instrument at FVTPL
	
	
FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. 
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the 
criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or 
as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
	
	
In addition, the Group may elect to designate a debt 
instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or 
FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election 
is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a 
measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred 
to as ‘accounting mismatch’). 
	
	
Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category 
are measured at fair value with all changes recognized 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Equity investments
	
	
All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 
are measured at fair value. The Group may 
make an irrevocable election to present in other 
comprehensive income subsequent changes in the 
fair value. The Group makes such election on an 
instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification 
is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
	
	
If the Group decides to classify an equity instrument 
as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in 
the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from 
OCI to consolidated statement of profit or loss, even 
on sale of investment. However, the Group may 
transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
	
	
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL 
category are measured at fair value with all changes 
recognized in the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss.
	
	
The equity securities which are not held for trading, 
and for which the Group has made an irrevocable 
election at initial recognition to recognize changes 
in fair value through OCI rather than profit or loss 
as these are strategic investments and the Group 
considered this to be more relevant.
	
	
Equity investments in associates and joint ventures 
are measured at cost. The investments are reviewed 
at each reporting date to determine whether there 
is any indication of impairment considering the 
provisions of Ind AS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. If 
any such indication exists, policy for impairment of 
non-financial assets is followed.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from 
the Group’s consolidated balance sheet) when:
	
	
•	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired, or

Annual Report

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
•	
The Group has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party under a 
‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the 
Group has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
	
	
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from an asset or has entered into a 
pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to 
what extent it has retained the risks and rewards 
of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the 
Group continues to recognise the transferred asset 
to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement. 
In that case, the Group also recognises an 
associated liability. The transferred asset and the 
associated liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that the Group 
has retained.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies 
expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss on financial 
assets that are debt instruments, and are measured 
at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, 
deposits, trade receivables and bank balance.
	
	
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade 
receivables. The application of simplified approach 
does not require the Group to track changes in 
credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss 
allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting 
date, right from its initial recognition. 
	
	
For recognition of impairment loss on other financial 
assets and risk exposure, the Group determines 
that whether there has been a significant increase 
in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit 
risk has not increased significantly, 12-month 
expected credit loss (ECL) is used to provide 
for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has 
increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a 
subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument 
improves such that there is no longer a significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then 
the entity reverts to recognising impairment loss 
allowance based on 12-month ECL.
	
	
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses 
resulting from all possible default events over 
the expected life of a financial instrument. The 
12-month ECL is a portion of the lifetime ECL which 
results from default events that are possible within 
12 months after the reporting date.
	
	
ECL is the difference between all contractual cash 
flows that are due to the Group in accordance 
with the contract and all the cash flows that the 
entity expects to receive (i.e., all cash shortfalls), 
discounted at the original EIR.
	
	
The Group uses a provision matrix to determine 
impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its 
trade receivables. The provision matrix is based 
on its historically observed default rates over 
the expected life of the trade receivables and is 
adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every 
reporting date, the historical observed default 
rates are updated and changes in the forward-
looking estimates are analysed.
	
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) 
recognized during the period is recognized as 
income/ expense in the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss. This amount is reflected under 
the head other expenses in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss. For the financial assets 
measured as at amortised cost ECL is presented 
as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the 
measurement of those assets in the consolidated 
balance sheet. The allowance reduces the net 
carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off 
criteria, the Group does not reduce impairment 
allowance from the gross carrying amount.
 
 
Financial liabilities
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial 
liabilities 
are 
classified, 
at 
initial 
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, 
payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
	
	
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair 
value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable transaction 
costs.
	
	
The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings, 
lease liabilities, trade and other payables.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on 
their classification as described below: 
	
	
Loans and borrowings
	
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans 
and borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and 
losses are recognised in profit or loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as through the 
EIR amortisation process. 
	
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The 
EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as 
the derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss.
	
	
Embedded derivatives
	
	
An embedded derivative is a component of a 
hybrid (combined) instrument that also includes a 
non-derivative host contract – with the effect that 
some of the cash flows of the combined instrument 
vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative. 
An embedded derivative causes some or all of the 
cash flows that otherwise would be required by the 
contract to be modified according to a specified 
interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity 
price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or 
rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, 
provided in the case of a non-financial variable that 
the variable is not specific to a party to the contract. 
Reassessment only occurs if there is either a 
change in the terms of the contract that significantly 
modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be 
required or a reclassification of a financial asset out 
of the fair value through profit or loss.
	
	
If the hybrid contract contains a host that is a 
financial asset within the scope of Ind AS 109, the 
Group does not separate embedded derivatives. 
Rather, it applies the classification requirements 
contained in Ind AS 109 to the entire hybrid 
contract. Derivatives embedded in all other host 
contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives 
and recorded at fair value if their economic 
characteristics and risks are not closely related to 
those of the host contracts and the host contracts 
are not held for trading or designated at fair value 
though profit or loss. These embedded derivatives 
are measured at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognized in profit or loss, unless designated as 
effective hedging instruments.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial 
assets 
and 
financial 
liabilities 
are 
offset and the net amount is reported in the 
consolidated balance sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised 
amounts and there is an intention to settle on 
a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the  
liabilities simultaneously.
 
o. 
Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the consolidated 
balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand 
and short-term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less, which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
	
	
For the purpose of the consolidated statement 
of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist 
of cash and short-term deposits, as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they 
are considered an integral part of the Group’s  
cash management.
 
p. 
Leases
 
 
The Group as a lessee
	
	
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist 
of leases for land and office premises. The Group 
assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at 
inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, 
a lease if the contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period of time 
in exchange for consideration. To assess whether 
a contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (i) 
the contact involves the use of an identified asset 
(ii) the Group has substantially all of the economic 
benefits from use of the asset through the period 
of the lease and (iii) the Group has the right to 
direct the use of the asset.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) 
and a corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for 
leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-
term leases) and low value leases. For these short-
term and low value leases, the Group recognizes 
the lease payments as an operating expense on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
	
	
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to 
extend or terminate the lease before the end of the 
lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably certain that 
they will be exercised.
	
	
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the 
lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or prior to the commencement date of 
the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease 
incentives. They are subsequently measured at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, if any.
	
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated 
for recoverability whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. 
the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and 
the value-in-use) is determined on an individual 
asset basis unless the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are largely independent of those 
from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable 
amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit 
(CGU) to which the asset belongs.
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized 
cost at the present value of the future lease 
payments. The lease payments are discounted using 
the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily 
determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates 
in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease 
liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding 
adjustment to the related right of use asset if the 
Group changes its assessment if whether it will 
exercise an extension or a termination option.
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately 
presented in the consolidated balance sheet and 
lease payments have been classified as financing 
cash flows.
 
q. 
Earnings/ (loss) per share (EPS)
	
	
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the 
profit/ (loss) for the year attributable to equity 
holders by the weighted average number of Equity 
shares outstanding during the year excluding the 
treasury shares.
	
	
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing 
the profit/ (loss) attributable to equity holders by 
the weighted average number of Equity shares 
outstanding during the year plus the weighted 
average number of Equity shares that would be 
issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential 
Equity shares into Equity shares.
 
r. 
Treasury shares
	
	
Own equity instruments that are reacquired 
(treasury shares) are recognised at cost and 
deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised 
in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. 
Any difference between the carrying amount and 
the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in 
other reserve.
 
s. 
Segment reporting
	
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
chief operating decision-maker. The Chief Operating 
decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources 
and assessing performance of the operating 
segments and makes strategic decisions. Refer Note 
34 for segment information presented.
 
t. 
Use of estimates 
	
	
The Group is required to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
of assets, liabilities, disclosure of contingent 
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenue 
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates. The 
Group bases its estimates on historical experience 
and on various other assumptions that are believed 
to be reasonable, the results of which form the 
basis for making judgements about carrying values 
of assets and liabilities.

u. 
Exceptional Items
	
	
On certain occasions, the size, type or incidence 
of an item of income or expense, pertaining to 
the ordinary activities of the Group is such that 
its disclosure improves the understanding of 
the performance of the Group. Such income or 
expense is classified as an exceptional item and 
accordingly disclosed in the consolidated financial 
statements. Significant impact on the consolidated 
financial statements arising from impairment of 
goodwill, impairment of investments in associates 
and gain/ loss on disposal of subsidiaries and 
associates (other than major lines of business that 
meet the definition of a discontinued operation) are 
considered and reported as exceptional items.
 
v. 
Contributed Equity
 
 
Equity shares are classified as equity.
	
	
The transaction costs of an equity transaction are 
accounted for as a deduction from equity (net of 
any related income tax benefit) to the extent they 
are incremental costs directly attributable to the 
equity transaction that otherwise would have been 
avoided. Qualifying transaction costs incurred in 
anticipation of an issuance of equity instruments 
is deferred on the balance sheet until the equity 
instrument is recognised. Deferred costs are 
subsequently reclassified as a deduction from 
equity when the equity instruments are recognised. 
If the equity instruments are not subsequently 
issued, the deferred transaction costs are charged 
off to profit or loss.
	
	
The transaction costs incurred with respect to the 
IPO of the Holding Company as reduced by the 
amount recovered from the selling shareholders are 
allocated between new issue of shares and listing 
of existing equity shares. The costs attributable to 
listing of existing shares is recognised in profit or 
loss and the costs attributable to new issuance of 
shares is recognised in equity.

# This amount is including cross charge of H 2 (March 31, 2021: 5). Net depreciation charge of Right-of-use assets in profit & loss is H 271 (March 
31, 2021 H 256).	
	
	
	
	
The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Company becomes obliged to 
exercise (or not exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty is only revised if a significant event or a significant 
change in circumstances occurs, which affects this assessment, and that is within the control of the lessee. During the 
year ended March 31, 2022, the Group has given notice to vacate certain office premises. This has been accounted as 
lease termination. Hence, in accordance with Ind AS 116, Lease Liability has been re-measured by H 9 (March 31, 2021: 
1,476) with corresponding adjustment to Right of Use assets amounting to H 6 (March 31, 2021: 1,426) and the remaining 
balance has been included in Miscellaneous Income disclosed under Other Income in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
The total cash outflow for leases for the year is H 402 (March 31, 2021: 469)
 
Extension and termination options:
	
Extension and termination options are included in ceratin leases. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in 
terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s operations. In certain cases, the extension and termination options 
held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.

21. Earnings per shares (EPS)
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of equity shares that would 
be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares. 
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:

* In view of losses during the current year and previous year, the options which are anti-dilutive have been ignored in the calculation of diluted earnings 
per share. Accordingly, there is no variation between basic and diluted earnings per share.
# Pursuant to the approval of the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Holding Company held on June 30, 2021, each equity share of 
face value of H 10 per share was sub-divided into ten equity shares of face value of H 1 per share, with effect from record date, i.e., June 30,2021. 
Consequently, the basic and diluted earnings per share have been computed for current year and previous year on the basis of the new number of 
equity shares in accordance with Ind AS 33, Earning per share.
22. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying 
disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in 
outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 12 months, 
are described below.
Deferred taxes and Income taxes
Deferred tax assets can be recognised for deductible temporary differences (including unused tax losses) only to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. 
Most of the companies forming part of the Group are yet to generate operating profits, Management has assessed that as 
at March 31, 2022 it is not probable that such deferred tax assets can be realised in excess of available taxable temporary 
differences. Management re-assesses unrecognized deferred tax assets at each reporting date and recognizes to the extent 
that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. For details about 
deferred tax assets, refer note 28.	
During FY 2019-20 (AY 2020-21) a shareholder of the Holding Company holding 30.33% of shares of the Holding Company has 
transferred its shareholding to its group company (both entities being 100% subsidiaries of the same ultimate parent entity). 
Based on advice from the Holding Company’s tax experts, Management has assessed that a mere change in shareholding 
within the same group will not be an affirmative position to say that the shareholding has been changed. Further, since

the shares of the Group carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power were beneficially held by persons, i.e. 
ultimate holding company of the aforesaid entities, who beneficially held shares of the Holding Company carrying not less 
than fifty-one percent of the voting power on the last day of the year or years in which the loss was incurred, the Group 
shall be entitled to carry forward and set off these losses against the taxable income of future years in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 79 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. (refer note 28)
Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial 
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the 
future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in 
these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated , the management considers the interest rates of government 
bonds. The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. The mortality tables tend to change only at interval 
in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation 
rates. For further details about gratuity obligations, refer note 27.
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet cannot be 
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the 
DCF model, Price of Recent Investment (PORI) method and Comparable Company Multiples (CCM) method. The inputs to 
these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is 
required in establishing fair values. For further details about Fair value measurement, refer note 31.
Impairment of financial assets	
The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit risks associated with its assets carried at amortized 
cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. Note 32 
details how the Group determines whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
Impairment reviews
Goodwill is tested for impairment at-least on an annual basis or when events that occur / changes in circumstances indicate 
that the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying value. In calculating the value in use, the Group is required to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions inter-alia concerning the growth in EBITDA, long-term growth rates; discount 
rates to reflect the risks involved. Also, judgement is involved in determining the CGU for allocation of the goodwill.  For 
details about impairment reviews, refer note 36.
Incentives
The Group provide incentives to users in various forms including cashbacks to promote its platform. Incentives to  users to 
whom the Group has a performance obligation is recorded as a reduction of revenue to the extent of the revenue earned. 
For the incentives to other transacting users to whom the Group has no performance obligation, management is required to 
determine whether the incentives are in substance a payment on behalf of the merchants and should therefore be recorded 
as a reduction of revenue or as marketing and promotional expenses. Some of the factors considered in management’s 
evaluation of such incentives being payments on behalf of  merchants include whether the incentives are given at the 
Group’s discretion, contractual agreements with the merchants, business strategy and objectives and design of the incentive 
program(s), etc.

B.	 The following table illustrates the summarised financial information of the Group’s investment in 
joint venture.
# The net worth of Paytm First Games Private Limited, a joint venture of the Group, has been fully eroded with net current liabilities. The carrying 
value of the share of investment in the consolidated financial statements is reduced to ‘Nil’ as the group is not liable to contribute in excess of  
their contribution.
The management has concluded that the Group doesn’t control Paytm First Games Private Limited  (formerly known as Gamepind Entertainment 
Private Limited) even if it holds more than half of the voting rights of the investee entity. As per management’s judgement and evaluation,  the Group 
doesn’t have unilateral ability to direct the relevant activities.  The Group and other investor has ability to jointly direct the relevant activities of the 
investee entity by virtue of shareholder’s agreement and hence considered to be a joint venture.

A quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant assumption as at March 31, 2021 is as shown below:
	
The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined 
benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. The 
methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior year.
	
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the year ending March 31, 2023 are H 162 (March 31, 2022 - H 113).
	
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 2.78 years (March 31, 2021: 2.76 years).

Risk exposure
	
Through its defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed 
below:
	
Asset volatility: The plan assets are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond yields. If plan assets 
underperform this yield, there will be a deficit of the plan asset investments in fixed income securities with high grades 
and in government securities. These are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk to an 
acceptable level.
	
Changes in bond yields: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If 
bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
	
Inflation risks: The payments are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
	
Life expectancy: Obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy and 
inflation will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities. This is particularly significant where inflationary conditions result 
in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.

The Group will continue to assess the impact of further developments relating to retrospective application of Supreme 
Court judgement dated February 28, 2019 clarifying the definition of ‘basic wages’ under Employees’ Provident Fund and 
Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1952 and deal with it accordingly. In the assessment of the management, the aforesaid matter is 
not likely to have a significant impact and accordingly, no provision has been made in these Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Holding Company has been made aware of certain matters/claims relating to infringement of trademarks and patents 
in relation to the business activities carried on by it. The Holding Company actively monitors such matters/claims along with 
appropriate legal/technology experts to assess their veracity and takes action as considered necessary. In the opinion of the 
management, no material liability is likely to arise on account of such matters/claims, based on assessments made to date.

32. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group 
continues to focus on a system-based approach to business risk management. The Group’s financial risk management 
process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business. 
Backed by strong internal control systems, the current Risk Management Framework rests on policies and procedures issued 
by appropriate authorities; process of regular internal reviews/audits to set appropriate risk limits and controls; monitoring of 
such risks and compliance confirmation for the same.  
a.	 Market Risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market prices comprise three types of risk: interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and price risk. The 
Group has in place appropriate risk management policies to limit the impact of these risks on its financial performance. 
The Group ensures optimization of cash through fund planning and robust cash management practices.
 
(i) Interest Rate Risk
	
	
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates. 
	
	
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s borrowings with 
floating interest rates.
	
	
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, being a 0.5% 
increase or decrease in interest rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s loss before tax due to the 
impact on floating rate borrowings.
As at
March 31, 2022
March 31, 2021
Effect on loss before tax:
Decrease by 50 bps
(*)
(27)
Increase by 50 bps
*
27
	
	
Other financial assets and liabilities of the Group are either non-interest bearing or fixed interest bearing instruments, 
the Group’s net exposure to interest risk on such instruments is negligible.
	
	
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a reasonably possible change in the under-lying interest rate of the 
Group’s borrowings while assuming all other variables to be constant. 
	
	
Based on the movements in the interest rates historically and the prevailing market conditions as at the reporting date, 
the Group’s management has concluded that the above mentioned rates used for sensitivity are reasonable benchmarks.
	
	
*Amount below rounding off norms adopted by the Group
 
(ii) Price risk
	
	
The Group invests its surplus funds in various debt instruments, fixed deposits and debt mutual funds. These 
comprise of primarily debt based mutual funds (liquid investments), debentures and fixed deposits. As on March 31, 
2021, all mutual fund investments were in liquid scheme only.
	
	
Mutual fund investments are susceptible to market price risk, mainly arising from changes in the interest rates or 
market yields which may impact the return and value of such investments. 
	
	
Set out below is the impact of a 0.25% movement in the NAV of mutual funds and debt instruments on the Group’s 
loss before tax:

The Group is also exposed to equity/ preference shares price risk arising from investments held by the Group and 
classified in the balance sheet either as fair value through OCI or at fair value through profit or loss (refer note 6(a) 
and 6(b)). To manage its price risk arising from investments in equity/preference shares, the Group diversifies its 
portfolio. Diversification of the portfolio is done in accordance with the limits set by the Group.
 
(iii) Foreign currency risk
	
	
The Indian Rupee is the Group’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the Group’s results are presented 
in Indian Rupee and exposures are managed against Indian Rupee accordingly. Foreign currency risk is the risk 
that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s operating 
activities and investing activities (when revenue, expense and Property, Plant and Equipment is denominated in a  
foreign currency).
	
	
The carrying amounts of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities denominated in United States Dollar (USD) are 
as follows:

The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity of profit or loss to a reasonably possible change in USD exchange 
rates, with all other variables held constant. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies 
is not material.

Effect on loss before tax

(16)
	
	
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a reasonably possible change in the under-lying foreign currency against 
the functional currency while assuming all other variables to be constant.
	
	
Based on the movements in the foreign exchange rates historically and the prevailing market conditions as at the 
reporting date, the Group’s management has concluded that the above mentioned rates used for sensitivity are 
reasonable benchmarks.
b.	 Credit Risk
	
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or contract, leading to a 
financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its 
investing activities, including deposits with banks. Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit 
risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
All of the Group investments and loans at amortised cost are considered to have low credit risk, and the loss allowance 
recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 months expected losses. Management considers instruments 
to be low credit risk when they have a low risk of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual 
cash flow obligations in the near term.
 
(i) Trade receivables
	
	
The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers. Customer credit risk is managed 
subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. An 
impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date by grouping the receivables in homogeneous group. The 
calculation is based on lifetime expected credit losses.

33.	Capital Management
The Group’s objectives while managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to generate 
adequate returns for its shareholders and ensuring benefits for other stakeholders. The key objective of the Group’s capital 
management is to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with the focus on total equity, uphold investor; creditor 
and customer confidence, and ensure future development of its business activities. The Group manages its capital structure 
and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions or its business requirements.
The Group’s capital management objective is to remain majorly a debt-free Group till the time it achieves break-even. In 
order to meet this objective, Group meets anticipated funding requirements for developing new businesses, expanding its 
geographical base, entering in to strategic mergers and acquisitions and other strategic investments, by issuance of equity 
capital together with cash generated from Group’s operating and investing activities. The Group utilizes certain working 
capital facilities in the form of short term bank overdraft to meet anticipated interim working capital requirements. 
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the year ended March 31, 2022 
and March 31, 2021.

34. Segment Reporting
During the previous year, the Group reassessed the basis of segment reporting. This reassessment had been necessitated 
by the change in business strategy over the period, increased interdependency between various service lines, increased 
fungibility of resources/common cost, change in the way Board of Directors (Chief Operating Decision Maker “CODM”) 
review Group’s performance etc. Earlier, the Company disclosed four reportable segments that were Payment, Commerce, 
Cloud and others.
In line with the above shift in business strategy and the consequent change in the way the CODM reviews the performance, 
management of the Group has aligned segment disclosure to the above change. Further, it has been concluded that though 
there are different business units of the Group, including Payment and Financial services, Commerce and cloud services, 
information reviewed by the CODM is at the revenue level and the Group does not allocate operating costs and expenses, 
assets and liabilities across business units, as the CODM does not use such information to allocate resources or evaluate 
the performance of the business units. Allocation of resources and assessment of financial performance is done at the 
consolidated level.
Accordingly, it has been assessed that Group operates in a single Operating as well as Reportable Segment. 
The Group has revenues primarily from customers domiciled in India. Substantially all of the Group’s non-current operating 
assets are domiciled in India.
Information about major customers
Revenues of H 10,107 are derived from one external customer (March 31, 2021: H 8,634 from one external customer).

36. Impairment review of goodwill arising on Consolidation
The Group monitors the business of the respective acquisitions independently and thus considers each acquisition as a 
separate Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’).

The Group reviews the goodwill for any impairment at the CGU level. The recoverable amount of the above CGUs are based 
on value-in-use, which is determined based on five year business plans that have been approved by the management 
for internal purposes. The said planning horizon of five years reflects the assumptions for short to medium-term market 
developments. The cash flows beyond the planning period are extrapolated using appropriate terminal growth rates. The 
terminal growth rates used do not exceed the long term average growth rates of the respective industry and country in 
which the entity operates and are consistent with the internal/external sources of information.
The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations are as follows: 
	
•	
Earnings before interest and taxes margins (‘EBIT’) 
	
•	
Discount rate
	
•	
Growth rates
EBIT margins: The margins have been estimated based on past experience after considering incremental revenue arising 
out of increase in payment business from the existing and new customers. Margins will be positively impacted from 
the efficiencies and initiatives driven by the Group; whereas, factors like increased cost of operations may impact the  
margins negatively. 
Discount rate: Discount rate reflects the current market assessment of the risks specific to the CGU estimated based on the 
weighted average cost of capital. Pre-tax discount rate used ranged from 20% to 25% (March 31, 2021 20% to 25%) which 
in the opinion of management are consistent with companies in similar business.
Growth rates: The terminal growth rates used are in the opinion of management in line with the long-term average growth 
rates of the respective industry in which the entity operates and are consistent with the internal/external sources of 
information. The terminal growth rates used in extrapolating cash flows beyond the planning period, range from 1.5 to 2.5 
times (March 31, 2021 - 1.5 to 2.5 times) of revenue for the terminal year.
Goodwill Impairment 
During the year ended March 31, 2022, the goodwill arising on account of consolidation has been impaired based on above 
mentioned analysis. 
During the year ended March 31, 2021, no additional impairment is required based on above-mentioned analysis.
Below is the table showing the value of goodwill impaired for the subsidiaries.

1. Our Ways of Working 
 
At our core, we at One97 Communications Limited and all its affiliates and subsidiaries who have 
formally adopted this policy (hereby collectively referred to as ‘Paytm’ or ‘Company’), are guided 
by a set of unwavering core values and guiding principles that have been etched into the very 
fabric of our being. These values are a living testament to the unshakeable principles that 
underpin our commitment to “Bringing Half-a-Billion Indians to the Mainstream Economy.” By 
articulating what we stand for, we aim to provide clarity to all who join our journey as our 
employees, partners, stakeholders, shareholders, regulators and those interested in our journey. 
 
 
 
On an everyday basis, we hold ourselves and our colleagues to high standards of professional 
conduct. While our Code of Conduct (CoC) outlines essential guidelines, we reach new heights by 
living our cultural norms every day in everything we do. Here excellence isn't just encouraged – it's 
expected. Our cultural norms set the bar higher, ensuring that excellence is not just a requirement 
but a path to success. Appendix A covers additional information on our ways of working. 
 
2. Purpose and Scope 
 
The Company strives to provide a work environment that is healthy, respectful and fair. This policy 
establishes rules for conduct to maintain a productive work environment. The CoC has been 
prepared to help you understand the minimum expectations with respect to business practices for 
the Company, and to comply with the same. 
 
The CoC also serves as a guide to our Personnel to take ownership and resolve, and when 
required, report anything that they observe or know about, that might violate these principles. 
Violation of the CoC is a serious matter and will result in action as per the Company’s 
Consequence Management policy listed on the Company Intranet. It is important that you read this CoC 
carefully and clarify anything you do not understand. Each of us must understand and accept our 
personal responsibility in preserving and enhancing the Company’s reputation and take pride in 
doing the right thing. 
 
2.1 Who is Covered by our CoC 
 
Our CoC applies to all employees, trainees, consultants, and associates (“collectively or 
individually referred to “Personnel”) of One97 Communications Limited, that of all its affiliates and 
subsidiaries who have formally adopted this policy (hereby collectively referred to as ‘Paytm’ or 
‘Company’). The provisions of this CoC are applicable in addition to other Policies / Codes as 
may be framed and implemented by the Company, to meet regulatory requirements from time to 
time. 
 

File: combined_policies, Page number: 4

In our effort to make the CoC more accessible to all Company Personnel, it has been translated 
into multiple languages. As part of the wider Paytm ecosystem, we expect our suppliers, vendors, 
service providers, and other business partners to act with integrity and honor our values when 
conducting their business. 
 
2.2 What is my Responsibility? 
 
If the CoC applies to you, it is your responsibility to have read it and sought any clarification around 
it. Lack of understanding of CoC does not qualify as an acceptable reason for violation. Reading 
through this document will clarify the expectations around our Ways of Working and our CoC. If 
you are not sure what is the right thing to do, ask for advice from the HR team and/or your 
manager. They can guide you in the right direction and possible action you could take in the 
situation. 
 
If you see, suspect, or are in the know of any activity that violates the Company’s CoC, compliance 
policies, the standards for suppliers, or the law of the land, it is your duty to take corrective action 
and to report it. As a responsible Personnel of the Company, you are required to take the lead to 
stop incorrect practices and to report them to the right channels. When you report your concerns 
via the right channels, if called upon, cooperate fully and honestly in any internal investigations. In 
most scenarios, concerns can be reported to your manager, HRBP, or Employee escalation email 
and Hotline mentioned below. 
 
All escalations to any of the above sources regarding a potential COC violation are treated as 
confidential and details shared only as part of the investigation on a need to know basis. While you 
can choose to report a CoC or ethics violation anonymously, however it helps with the process if 
you identify yourself. Your identity will be protected during the investigation as far as reasonable to 
do so. Additionally, the Company has strong policies against any form of retaliation against anyone 
who may raise a potential concern or violation. 
 
Ways to Reach Out 
 
● Contact your Manager, your HRBP and Internal Audit in that order if you have any concerns or 
questions. 
● Should you wish to report you can also do so by Phone - 0008000502403 (If you wish to raise 
a concern, please dial the 13 digits toll free number. Available in: English, Hindi, Marathi, 
Gujarati, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali and Tamil)

2.3 Speak without the Fear of Retaliation 
 
The Company does not tolerate retaliation for reporting a concern or participating in an 
investigation. Any Personnel who engages in retaliation will be subject to disciplinary action. If you 
feel that you have been retaliated against for reporting a concern, report to your manager, HRBP, or 
Employee escalation email and Hotline mentioned at Point 2.2. 
 
Retaliation against or discouraging someone from reporting CoC related concerns is prohibited 
and may result in disciplinary action against the person, which can include but is not limited to

termination of employment. Reporting an issue in good faith will not get you in trouble, even if you 
make a mistake. However, knowingly reporting false information will be subject to disciplinary 
action. 
 
All reports of misconduct and violation of CoC are investigated. However, information regarding 
these investigations is shared only on a need-to-know basis. Reporting a possible misconduct 
will not entitle an Personnel to receive updates about the investigation or the outcome. As part of 
an investigation, if you are called upon and to participate or share information, it is imperative that 
you cooperate with the process and give honest and complete answers. You are further obligated 
to maintain complete confidentiality even if you come across information as part of the 
investigation. 
 
3. Serving our Customers/Users

unprofessional behavior towards an individual or a group of Personnel is regarded as a violation of 
the CoC and will result in appropriate action against those found responsible. 
 
4.5. Respect the safety and health of all Personnel. Do not work under the influence of alcohol and 
improper use of drugs as they can affect your work and the safety of people around you. Drive 
safely and show concern for others on the road. Getting there safely is more important than getting 
there quickly. Conduct yourself in a manner to respect and protect the environment. 
 
4.6. Preserve Confidentiality. We get a lot of media attention around our innovations and culture. 
However, certain kinds of Company information, if leaked prematurely into the media or to 
competitors, can hurt our product launches and eliminate our competitive advantage. Our 
responsibilities extend beyond just not revealing confidential Company information. If you are

5. Recognize and Avoid Conflict of Interest: 
 
Fair and objective decisions build trust with our Personnel. 
When making business decisions, we put the Company’s 
interests before personal interests. A conflict of interest (CoI) 
occurs when personal interests interfere with, or may appear 
to interfere with our work at the Company. It’s important to 
know and avoid the situations that could create a conflict or 
even the perception of a conflict. Outside employment, 
financial investments, gifts & entertainment and personal 
relationships are examples of a few areas where conflict can 
arise. If you realize an activity or situation could influence or 
appear to influence your ability to make objective business 
decisions, let your manager or HR know. They can help you 
take steps to avoid or resolve a conflict. For more details 
about CoI, please read the Conflicts of Interest Policy 
displayed on the Company Intranet. 
 
 
 
Think about it! 
 
Ask these questions when you’re unsure 
about whether a situation may lead to a 
conflict or the perception of a conflict:

Conflict of Interest for someone who is an employee of OCL and Director in another entity or affiliate 
or subsidiary of OCL: 
 
The nominee directors of OCL or other Companies on Board of Subsidiary / Associate should 
discharge their fiduciary duties as Director on Board of such Companies in event of a perceived or 
potential conflict of interest vis a vis interest of OCL or other Companies. 
 
Consequences of CoC Violation: 
 
If the Company restates its financial statements due to fraud or regulatory noncompliance the 
Company shall seek to recover any Incentive Based Compensation received by its Key (KMP) and 
/ Senior Management professionals (SMP) executive officers that is in excess of what they would 
have been payable on the basis of the restated books of accounts. 
 
5.1.  Outside Employment and Business Interests: Dual employment in any form or any other 
commercial pursuit / undertaking /assignment (irrespective of whether or not it is generating any 
income) is prohibited by the employment contract with Paytm. For any special circumstances, you 
are required to check with the HR team and seek written permission to be employed or take on 
additional assignments outside of Paytm while in employment with the Company. For more details 
about CoI, please read Conflicts of Interest Policy displayed on the Company Intranet. 
 
5.2.  Financial Investments: Do not invest in a Company’s supplier if you can influence the 
Company’s relationship with that supplier. Do not have any substantial interest (stock ownership) in 
a competitor. Investment in any other company more than 1%, or directorships, should be disclosed. 
 
5.3. Employee Relationships - Family, Friends & Romantic: Do not supervise or be directly 
involved in the hiring of a family member, close friend or romantic partner. Do not influence the 
conditions of employment (for example, pay, work hours, or job responsibilities) or performance 
rating of any family member, close friend or romantic partner. Do not have a romantic relationship 
with another Personeel if the Personnel is in your chain of command or if you have influence over 
the Personnel’s conditions of employment or performance rating. 
 
5.4. Supplier Relationships: Before participating in the selection of a supplier who employs your 
family member, is a close personal friend, or a romantic partner, disclose the relationship to your 
manager, HRBP, or Employee escalation email and Hotline mentioned at Point 2.2 to get advice on 
how to manage the potential conflict.

Intranet.

6. Ensure Financial Integrity and Responsibility: 
 
Financial integrity and fiscal responsibility are fundamental to the way we conduct our business. We 
represent our Company, customers and stakeholders in every business transaction and dealings we 
undertake, and we expect our Personnel to always operate with this sense of responsibility. This 
responsibility goes beyond accurate financial reporting; it's about safeguarding the Company’s 
interest and optimal utilization of its funds, whether it's vendor dealings, expenses, contracts, or any 
financial transactions. We maintain robust internal controls to ensure compliance with all legal and 
regulatory requirements at all our locations. Adhering to our internal controls is vital. Here are key 
principles that underpin our commitment to financial integrity and fiscal responsibility. If you have 
questions, please contact your manager, HRBP, or Employee escalation email and Hotline 
mentioned at Point 2.2 or Finance. 
 
6.1.  Spending the Company's Money: When you incur an expense while conducting Company 
business or spend money on the Company's behalf, it is our responsibility to ensure that the cost is 
reasonable, directly related to the Company's business and supported by appropriate 
documentation. Always record the business purpose and comply with other submission 
requirements. If you're uncertain about whether you should spend money or submit an expense for 
reimbursement, check with your manager. As a people manager, you are responsible for all money 
spent and expenses incurred by your direct reports, and such expenses should be carefully 
reviewed before approving. They should be in line with our Expenses Reimbursement Policy 
displayed on the Company Intranet. 
 
6.2.  Signing a Contract: Contracts create obligations - whether it is to purchase goods or 
services, or to provide services. This includes any purchase that you are approving on the 
Company's behalf. Each time you enter a business transaction on the Company's behalf, where 
such a business transaction involves purchases or services which are recurring in nature; it is 
mandatory to have the legal team involved and seek their sign-off on the agreement. 
 
6.3.  Hiring Suppliers: All suppliers and services should be on-boarded only after they have been 
reviewed by the Purchase team and appropriate purchase procedures have been followed. Please 
do not hesitate to contact the Purchase Team & if you have any questions regarding how to procure 
equipment or services. 
 
7. Protection & Use of Company Property 
 
The Company has a well-earned reputation for its employee benefits and transparent sharing of 
relevant information. Our ability to continue these practices depends on how well we conserve 
Company resources and protect Company assets and information. 
 
7.1. Company Assets: Company gives us the tools and equipment we need to do our jobs 
effectively, but counts on us to be responsible and not wasteful with the assets we are given. 
Please refer to IT policies on the Company Intranet to ensure you fully understand the Do’s and Don'ts 
when using company assets. 
 
7.2. Physical Security: Always secure your laptop, important equipment and your personal 
belongings, even while on Company's premises. Always wear your ID card visibly while on site. 
Don't tamper with or disable security and safety (eg: firefighting equipment, alarms, cameras and 
security gates etc.) If you see someone in a secure space without an ID card, report that, and any 
other suspicious activity to Company Security.

7.3. Use of Company Equipment and Facilities: This covers anything you do using Company’s 
corporate electronic facilities eg: computers, devices, network, etc. from/at our premises. In addition, 
the Company may monitor, access, and disclose employee correspondence or communications and 
other information residing/transmitted on our corporate electronic facilities or on our premises where 
there is a business need to do so, such as protecting its Personnel and users, maintaining the 
security of Company’s resources and property, or investigating suspected Personnel misconduct. 
 
7.4. Use of Personal Information: You may come across personal information- employee, 
customer, supplier data, as a part of your work. Access to this data is restricted and if you come 
across data that you believe is not required for your work, you are required to delete this data and 
notify the appropriate team and or your manager. If you have access, you have an obligation to 
protect the data and use it only for official purposes. Access to Personal information can be provided 
only in line with the local law and the Company’s internal policies, in a manner that is consistent with 
our Data security guidelines displayed on the Company Intranet. 
 
8. Compliance with Law, Rules & Regulations 
 
The Company takes its responsibilities to comply with the laws and regulations very seriously, 
and each one of us is expected to comply with applicable legal requirements and prohibitions 
impacting our area of work. We will ensure that all businesses obtain the necessary licenses and 
permits from the appropriate authority(ies) and comply with all licensing and permit obligations/ 
requirements. 
While we may not be experts in the legal aspect of licenses, we should familiarize ourselves and 
understand the major laws and regulations that apply to our work. Also, take advantage of subject 
matter experts within and outside the Company such as your Manager, HRBP, Legal, or Compliance 
teams to assist you here. Some specific laws could be violated unintentionally and so are worth 
pointing out here: 
 
8.1.  Competition Laws 
 
The Company endeavors to comply with all competition laws that apply to us. Generally speaking, 
these laws relate to: 1) arrangements with competitors that restrain free trade in some way, 2) abuse 
of intellectual property rights, and 3) use of market power to unfairly disadvantage competitors. 
 
Please seek guidance from the Legal and Compliance team when in doubt. 
 
8.2.  Insider Trading Laws 
 
You should assume that all information you learn at Paytm is confidential. Use of any information 
that you learn at Paytm for personal gain is prohibited by this policy and in certain cases, by law. 
 
Adherence to this is critical and any breach is most likely to result in disciplinary action or legal 
action. By virtue of your employment at Paytm you may be subject to restriction on sharing price 
sensitive information at any time and/or trading in Paytm shares during certain periods of the year. 
For more details, please refer to the Insider trading Policy displayed on the Company Intranet.

8.3.  Anti-Bribery Laws / Anti Money Laundering Laws 
 
The Company also complies with all applicable Anti-Money Laundering laws everywhere it does 
business, including any applicable registration and Suspicious Transaction Reporting obligations. 
When we contemplate providing new services or entering new markets/sectors/countries, we must 
always evaluate any new or additional Anti-Money Laundering obligations and risks and 
implement appropriate policies and/or procedures to meet these obligations and risks. For more 
details, please refer to the ABAC Policy displayed on the Company Intranet.

There are two ways you can do it 
Not to lose or 
Only for the win 
And these are two very different methods. 
 
 
Go Big 
 
 
Appendix A 
 
Sense of Responsibility 
We are humbled by the chance to bring about significant change in the lives of hundreds of millions 
of individuals. We view this as a unique opportunity to serve and enthusiastically own the 
responsibility to serve and create a positive impact at scale. We accept this, and hold ourselves and 
each other accountable to rise to it, by leading by example. This means our commitment to our 
mission always comes first, constantly raising the bar on what is acceptable. We have zero 
tolerance for individual glory. Working at Paytm is not a job, it is a vocation. 
 
Speed of Execution 
Speed is our bet on the market. We move fast in everything we do. We have learnt that being faster is a 
huge source of competitive advantage. We recognize that achieving speed necessitates 
discipline, meticulous planning and thorough preparation. It's about a relentless commitment to 
action, guided not by external validation, but by the intrinsic motivation of accomplishing something 
truly meaningful. We firmly believe that if a task or opportunity arises, it's best tackled immediately. 
 
Done is better than Perfect; "Doing it now" > "doing it today" > "doing it tomorrow." Even as we pursue 
the mindset of urgency we constantly improve the bar on experiences of products and experiences 
we launch. 
 
Pursuit of Excellence 
Each of us can do magic! With this belief, we pursue a high bar in all we do. We hire and promote the 
best individuals for every role, determined solely by who can do that job with the highest chance of 
success. We have zero tolerance for mediocrity, favoritism, or turf-protection. We are excited about 
the big ideas and opportunities and regardless of the size of the problem, we find ways to solve it. 
We meet our commitments. We are gracious with our chances but never blind to our opportunities. 
 
Even as these shared values define successful leadership at Paytm, we have a set of Guiding 
Principles that shape our thinking and enable high quality decision making. As we grow bigger, 
these guiding principles enable various individuals and leaders in their teams to make our values 
come to life, to decentralize decision making and to create shared momentum across our workforce. 
When we have multiple options to meet our goals, the guiding principles help us make the right 
choices.

Payments Bank, Paytm QR code, Paytm Soundbox. We recognize that being a pioneer comes 
with a lack of clear path to success, with possibility of being misunderstood. We also understand 
that being a pioneer requires courage, determination, and resilience. We build for the future. 
Behaviors 
What it is not 
● Take on big audacious goals. 
● Once decided, leave no stone turned 
● Be pioneers by taking on things never done

● Inability to break the big into smaller details 
● Rely on external benchmarks or status 
quo 
Agility Matters 
 
We led India’s QR and mobile payments revolution, empowering the grassroots of the country with 
robust digital payment solutions. QR has allowed small merchants to start accepting payments with 
no internet, and no investment in a point of sale device. Continuing with our commitment towards 
driving financial inclusion, we have launched a series of smart devices to accelerate India’s digital 
payment penetration 
We, at Paytm, firmly believe that technology when combined with a positive intent can create a huge 
impact. We are constantly working on innovative solutions that can make everyday life simpler: 
full-stack digital banking to underserved Indians, institutional financial services such as loans and 
bookkeeping and invoicing to micro, small and medium enterprises, and democratizing access to 
the formal credit and wealth management system 
We are in the business of staying relevant. We have the mental flexibility and humility to constantly 
evolve what we do and how we do it. We recognize that as unique as we are, we are part of the 
whole. The sooner we identify change and start preparing for it, the stronger we are going to be in 
the future. 
Behaviors 
What it is not 
● Flexible and open to change 
● Fail fast, recover from setbacks or 
disruptions 
● Committed to ongoing learning and 
improvement to stay relevant 
● Disrupt, destroy, rebuild 
● 
Frenetic motion without direction 
● 
Change for the sake of change 
● 
Impulsive decision making 
● 
“I know it all”; My way is better. 
● 
Losing sight of the important in the joy of 
the urgent 
Respect Those “in the Arena” 
We are a uniquely flat organization where everyone talks to everyone. Ideas matter, not levels. We 
protect this zealously. In practice this means we respect disagreements without fear or favor. We 
recognize misalignment in issues and escalate them immediately. In making decisions, we involve 
those most connected to the problem even when it means not having the “head of department” in 
the room. Management exists to enable and celebrate our people in the Arena, “who strive, who 
err, who dare and in doing so lead us to triumph”.

Behaviors 
What it is not 
● Execution > Ideas > role / level 
● Listen deeply to the “doers” 
● Convince or get convinced 
● Once decided - seek and give commitment 
● Escalation is good 
● Every problem within the org is my problem 
(to solve) 
● Free criss cross information flow 
● Strategy without insight or co creation 
● Creating conflict to further own agenda 
● Brush disagreement under the carpet 
● A “cc” culture 
● High need to know 
● Holding on to data or information 
● Vertical information pathways 
Transparency 
Transparency is our default. We are always completely transparent with information, even when 
things are not going according to plan. Transparency is a way of life when dealing with your 
manager, partners, peers, customers, regulators, and shareholders. Access to timely information 
enables us to put the right resources in solving the problem. It’s a lot harder to fix a problem if we 
don’t know it exists. Information is power - empower your people with the right information. 
Behaviors 
What it is not 
● Share information that can help others in 
doing their job 
● Be open about mistakes and failures, share 
your learnings 
● Take accountability of actions 
● Transparency is contextual, not 
everyone needs all the information 
● Analysis Paralysis 
● Cognitive burden- share without context 
or to avoid accountability 
Be Resourceful 
In our journey as an organization we have learned that constraint leads to innovation. Being 
resourceful in the face of adversity can mean the difference between sailing through a crisis or 
perishing. Ability to effectively utilize judgment and available resources to overcome challenges, 
solve problems, and achieve goals, because we believe you are what your situations make you. 
This requires creativity, adaptability, and the capacity to make the most of limited or unexpected 
resources, because it's not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. 
Behaviors 
What it is not 
 
● Resourceful individuals maintain a positive 
outlook 
● Frugality, be respectful of resources 
● Finding innovative solutions and 
unconventional approaches to problems 
● Collaborate to pool resources and expertise 
 
● Cutting corners to save costs 
● Missing the bigger picture to save on 
immediate expense 
● Relying on established solutions 
● Working in silos and reinventing the 
wheel

Customer Centricity 
Driving us forward every day is our mission to reach half a billion Indians. Everything we build is to 
serve them and hence all our business decisions are centered on our customer needs, 
preferences, and expectations. Our golden rule, “if you are not the customer, don’t build it”. We 
identify with our customers and each time our customer wins, we win. The real game changer is to 
be in the shoes of the customer to understand their needs whether stated or unstated. To delight 
them with solutions that they never imagined could exist. 
Behaviors 
What it is not 
● Understands products are never finished 
there is always an opportunity to better 
● Customer needs are dynamic and evolving; 
yesterday’s wow! is today’s minimum 
expectation 
● Understands impact of decisions on 
customers and build for a positive impact 
● Invest time with users, customers to co create 
better than before experiences 
● Investing in customer care and service 
● Building products that copy trends and 
fads because they work in the market 
● Maintaining status quo on product 
offering because they are doing well in 
the market 
● Letting differentiation drop in the market 
● Losing or reducing touch with users, and 
user journeys 
 
Keep it Fun 
In the end, it's all about enjoying the wild wild ride, about finding a reason to jump out of bed with joy 
and look forward to another day where we do incredible things with incredible people for an 
incredible customer experience. Working at Paytm is not a job, it is a passion, a vocation to make a 
difference and an opportunity to stand up and be counted amongst those who changed the status 
quo! 
Behaviors 
What it is not 
● Celebrate success 
● Build a workplace like it's your special place 
● Build teams that you love to hang with 
● Hard work and no fun 
● Absence of purpose 
● A job

and subsidiaries who have formally adopted this policy (hereby collectively referred to as ‘Paytm’ 
or ‘Company’). It also includes contractors. This Policy is deemed to be incorporated in the service 
conditions of all Personnel of the Company in India. (Local country laws will take precedence over 
this Policy where applicable.) 
 
2. Introduction 
 
All Personnel at the Company are expected to uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct at 
the workplace and in all their interactions with stakeholders. This means that the Personnel have a 
responsibility to: 
● Treat each other with dignity and respect

The fundamental objective of enunciating the Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment of 
Women at Workplace (“Policy”) is to set out guidelines and procedures with regard to prevention 
of sexual harassment at workplace. Separately, our Code of Conduct states that the Company 
does not approve of discrimination in employment based on race, religion or sex and is committed 
to providing a work environment that is transparent in its conduct, being fair and non- 
discriminatory. 
 
This Policy has been framed in accordance with the provisions of “The Sexual Harassment of 
Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013” and rules framed 
thereunder (hereinafter collectively “the Act”). Accordingly, while the Policy covers all the key 
aspects of the Act, for any further clarification, reference shall always be made to the Act and in 
the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Policy and the Act, the provisions of the Act 
shall prevail. 
 
This policy provides the framework for protection against sexual harassment of women at 
workplace, the prevention and redressal of complaints of sexual harassment and matters related to 
it. 
 
The Company discourages malicious allegations, since they can harm the sanctity of the process and 
the reputation of the Respondent.

obtained in the course of the inquiry process, recommendations of the Internal Complaints 
Committee, action taken by the HR are considered as confidential materials, and not published or 
made known to the public or media. 
 
4. Redressal Mechanism – Formal Intervention 
 
In compliance with the Act, any complaint under this Policy shall be followed by a formal redressal 
mechanism as set out in this Policy. 
 
4A. Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) 
 
To prevent instances of sexual harassment and to receive and effectively deal with complaints 
pertaining to the same, Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) has been appointed for the Company. 
(Attached as Annexure-1 to this Policy is the Internal Complaints Committee members’ details). 
Consistent with the Act, the ICC will manage the process of inquiry and redressal of sexual 
harassment complaints made by the Complainant/Aggrieved Woman. 
 
Composition of the ICC: 
 
● Presiding Officer: A woman employed at a senior level in the organization or workplace; 
● At least two members from amongst Personnel, committed to the cause of women or who 
have had the experience of social work or have legal knowledge; 
● One external member from amongst non-governmental organizations or associations 
committed to the cause of women or a person familiar with the issues relating to sexual 
harassment; and 
● At least one half of the total members nominated, being women. 
 
The ICC will be Responsible for: 
 
● Receiving complaints of sexual harassment at the workplace. Prima-facie review and 
determine whether the complaint falls within the definition of "Sexual Harassment". In the 
event the ICC makes a determination that the matter does not fall within the above 
definition, or under its purview for inquiry, it may recommend to the Complainant or the 
Aggrieved Woman to file the complaint with the HR investigations team or under the Ethics 
hotline as appropriate. In certain situations, ICC may do a preliminary hearing to establish 
whether the matter falls within its scope. Subject to remedies available to the 
Complainant/Aggrieved Woman under law, the ICC’s decision on whether or not the 
complaint presented falls in the purview of sexual harassment will be final. 
● Initiating and conducting inquiry as per the established procedure. 

File: combined_policies, Page number: 35

● Share a report with the Complainant and the Respondent, within the timelines stipulated 
under the Act, setting out the conclusions pursuant to the inquiry and the 
recommendations. 
● Coordinating with HR in implementing appropriate actions/recommendations. 
● Maintaining strict confidentiality throughout the process as per established guidelines. 
● Submitting annual reports in the prescribed format. 
 
For the purpose of inquiry, the ICC may nominate a minimum of three members including the 
Presiding Officer and an Independent external member to represent the ICC. 
 
4B. Lodging a Complaint 
 
An Aggrieved Woman can make/ submit a complaint regarding sexual harassment at workplace to 
the ICC within a period of 3 months from the date of incident/ last incident. It is strongly 
recommended that the complaint be in writing. The ICC may in exceptional circumstances extend 
the timeline by another 3 months for reasons recorded in writing, if it is satisfied with the reasons 
preventing the Complainant/Aggrieved Woman from lodging the complaint within the period of 3 
months from the date of incident/last incident. 
 
Where such a complaint cannot be made in writing, the Presiding Officer or any Member of the ICC 
shall render all reasonable assistance to the Aggrieved Woman for making the complaint in writing. 
 
If the Aggrieved Woman is unable to make a complaint inter-alia on account of her physical or 
mental incapacity, a complaint may be filed by: a. her immediate relative or friend; or b. her co- 
worker; or c. any person who has direct knowledge of the incident, with the written consent of the 
Complainant. 
 
The complaint shall be submitted by the complainant to the ICC in writing or shall be submitted to 
the IC electronically, inter alia 
● Reach the Internal Complaints Committee via mail at: icc@paytm.com 
● The complaint can also be physically submitted to any ICC member 
 
4C. Receiving a Complaint (Guidelines) 
 
Dealing with incidents of harassment is not like any other type of dispute. Complainants or 
Aggrieved Women may be embarrassed and distressed and it requires tact and discretion while 
receiving the complaint. The following points should be kept in mind by the recipient of the 
complaint: 
● Complaints must be heard with sensitivity and empathy and the Complainant/Aggrieved 
Woman must be informed that the Company takes her concerns seriously. The Complainant 
must be informed that these concerns will be reported to the appropriate ICC and requisite 
follow up will be done speedily. 
● Any complaint must be reviewed with the highest standard of objectivity, without any bias 
or preconceived judgment or any additional information about either the Complainant or the 
Respondent. 
● Written notes must be taken while listening to the Complainant. When taking notes, it is 
advisable to capture as far as possible verbatim narrative (Complainant’s own words). Clear 
description of the incident in simple and direct terms should be prepared and details should 
be confirmed back with the Complainant. 
● All notes must be kept strictly confidential. It is advisable to take the Complainant’s 
agreement before proceeding with a formal investigation or sharing the matter with ICC if the 

File: combined_policies, Page number: 36
6 
 
 
 
 
Complainant has reached out to anyone outside the ICC. However, if the Complainant 
refuses and the Complainant’s manager or HR SPOC believe that the matter is serious, they 
are required to inform the ICC who will reach out to the Complainant to seek confirmation on 
proceeding with an inquiry. The final decision on whether to seek an inquiry rests with the 
Complainant except in cases where ICC may determine that the matter does not fall under 
the definition of sexual harassment. If the Complainant is not willing to accord consent for 
the inquiry, such refusal shall be duly recorded in writing. 
● Prior to initiating a formal investigation, the Complainant must be advised that although the 
process is confidential, the Respondent needs to be informed and any witnesses and 
persons directly involved in the complaint process will also learn of the Complainant’s 
identity. 
 
4D. Resolution Procedure through Conciliation 
 
● Once the complaint is received, before initiating the inquiry, the ICC may take steps to 
conciliate the complaint between the Complainant and the Respondent. This step can be 
invoked only if requested by the Aggrieved Woman/ Complainant. 
● No monetary settlement can be made as part of such conciliation. 
● In case a settlement is arrived at between the Aggrieved Woman and the Respondent, the 
ICC records and reports the same to the HR for taking appropriate action. Resolution 
through conciliation is required to be concluded within 2 weeks of the receipt of complaint. 
● The ICC shall provide copies of the settlement to the Complainant and the Respondent. 
Where a settlement is arrived at, no further inquiry is to be conducted by the ICC. 
 
4E. Resolution Procedure through Formal Inquiry 
 
The ICC will initiate inquiry in the following cases: 
● Complaint has been received by ICC. 
● ICC has prima facie determined that the matter falls under the purview of sexual harassment. 
● No conciliation is requested by Aggrieved Woman. 
● Conciliation has not resulted in any settlement. 
● Complainant informs the ICC that any term or condition of the settlement arrived through 
conciliation, has not been complied with by Respondent.

communicate in writing to the ICC the names of witness/es that they propose to call. 
● The ICC shall call upon all witnesses mentioned by both the parties. The ICC shall provide 
every reasonable opportunity to the Complainant and the Respondent for putting forward 
and defending their respective case. 
● If either party desires to tender any documents by way of evidence before the ICC, the 
same is to be supplied as original copies of such documents. Signatures should be affixed on 
the respective documents to certify these to be original copies.

justice. 
● In conducting the inquiry, a minimum of three committee members including the Presiding 
Officer and an Independent external member shall be present.

full, effective and speedy implementation of this Policy. Where sexual harassment occurs as 
a result of an act or omission by any third party or outsider, the Company shall take all steps 
necessary and reasonable to assist the affected person in terms of support and preventive 
action. 
● In the event, the complaint does not fall under the purview of Sexual Harassment or the 
complaint does not disclose conduct constituting Sexual Harassment, the same would be 
dropped by ICC after recording the reasons thereof and the matter may be referred by ICC to 
HR investigations or the Ethics hotline as appropriate. 
● ICC will conduct the investigation without any delay. Delays on account of scheduling 
difficulties qua the ICC members should be avoided. If the delay is due to frequent absence 
or rescheduling by the Complainant or the Respondent, the same shall be put on record. 
● If the Complainant or Respondent desires to cross examine any witnesses, the ICC will 
facilitate the same and record the statements. In case the Complainant or Respondent seeks 
to ask questions to the other party, they may give them to the ICC, which records the 
statement of the other party. 
 
The ICC is required to complete the proceedings, including the submission of the Inquiry Report, 
within 90 days from the date on which the inquiry is commenced. The inquiry procedure should 
ensure absolute fairness to all parties.

leave she would be otherwise be entitled to;

the ICC.

5C. Termination of Inquiry 
 
ICC may terminate the inquiry or give an ex-parte decision on the complaint, if either the 
Complainant or the Respondent fail to remain present for 3 consecutive hearings of the ICC 
convened by the Presiding Officer, without sufficient reason. This right shall be exercised by ICC 
subject to serving upon the concerned party an advance written notice of 15 days. 
 
6. Action to be taken after inquiry 
 
Post the inquiry, the ICC submits its report containing the findings and recommendations to the 
Complainant and Respondent, who accept the report in writing if they agree with the findings. The 
ICC is to redact the names of the witnesses to protect their identities. Either or the parties may 
prefer a representation against the findings by the ICC, and the ICC shall accord such party an 
opportunity to make submissions on their representation. 
 
Once the two parties are in agreement with the findings report, it shall be submitted to the HR, 
within 10 days of completion of the inquiry. 
 
6A. Complaint Unsubstantiated 
 
When the ICC concludes the investigation with a finding that the allegation(s) against the 
Respondent has not been proved, it recommends to the HR that no action is required to be taken 
in the said matter. Further, the ICC ensures that both parties understand that the matter has been 
fully inquired into, the matter stands concluded and neither party will be disadvantaged within the 
Company. 
 
6B. Complaint Substantiated 
 
Where the ICC arrives at the conclusion that the allegation(s) against the Respondent has been 
proved, it recommends to the HR to take necessary action for sexual harassment as misconduct, in 
accordance with the applicable service rules and policies, and such action may include: 
1. Counseling 
2. Apology to be tendered by Respondent 
3. Written warning 
4. Withholding promotion and/or increments 
5. Suspension 
6. Termination from employment 
7. To deduct from the salary payable to the Respondent such sums as the ICC deems 
appropriate to be paid to the Aggrieved Woman as compensation inter-alia for trauma, 
suffering and emotional distress, loss in career opportunity endured by the Aggrieved 
Woman. 
8. Or any other action that the management may deem fit. 
 
The Company is required to act upon the recommendations within 60 days and confirm to the ICC. 
Post implementation of the actions, barring matters of termination of employment, HR is required 
to do a follow up within 30 days of the action with the Complainant to ascertain whether the 
behaviour complained of has in fact stopped, the resolution proposed by the ICC by way of 
recommendations is working satisfactorily.

6C. Penal Consequences of Sexual Harassment 
 
In case the ICC finds the degree of offense coverable under the Indian Penal Code, then this fact 
shall be mentioned in its report and appropriate action shall be initiated by the management of the 
Company, for making a Police Complaint. 
 
6d. Malicious Allegations 
 
Where the ICC arrives at the conclusion that the allegation against the Respondent is malicious or 
the Aggrieved Woman or the Complainant has made the complaint knowing it to be false or the 
Aggrieved Woman or the Complainant has produced any forged or misleading document, it may 
recommend to the Consequence Committee of the Company to take appropriate action against 
the Aggrieved Woman or the Complainant. 
While arriving at a conclusion that the complaint was based on malicious intent, the ICC will 
consider that mere inability to substantiate a complaint need not mean malicious intent. Malicious 
intent must be clearly established during the inquiry. 
 
6F. Awareness 
 
To ensure awareness around POSH policy and procedures, the HR team will: 
● Formulate and widely disseminate this Policy for raising awareness relating to the do’s and 
don’ts aiding prevention and redressal of sexual harassment at the workplace. 
● Carry out orientation programs for the Members of the ICC. 
● Conduct capacity building and skill building programs for the Members of the ICC. 
● Declare the names and contact details of all the Members of the ICC. 
● Introduce mandatory POSH training for employees and track compliance. 
 
Note: Any person contravening the confidentiality obligation will be subjected to disciplinary 
action and consequences as prescribed in the Act. For purposes of management reporting the 
identities of the employees involved are required to be masked. Additionally, any form of 
victimization or retaliation of either the Complainant or the Respondent will be treated as a breach 
of the Code of Conduct of the Company.

Confidential 
These assessments will ensure that the Internal Audit function maintains conformance 
with all relevant Internal Audit standards of audit practice, is adequately resourced, free 
from constraint and has the appropriate standing within the Group. 
 
Limitations 
 
General 
Internal Audit is a review and support activity. It does not relieve management of its 
responsibility for identification, evaluation and management of risks. 
Internal Audit will make recommendations for improvements, but it is management’s 
responsibility to implement these recommendations or other actions it deems to be 
appropriate. However, Internal Audit will report all risks that have been identified and in 
its opinion, are not satisfactorily addressed.  
To ensure transparency, the Internal Audit would report audit results to both the 
management and those charged with governance (the Audit Committee). 
 
Fraud 
Identification and prevention of fraud is a managerial responsibility. The Internal Audit 
function may assist management to identify fraud risks faced by various business units, 
and can assist management in recording appropriate controls that could minimize 
effects of the risks. However, the department(s)/functions(s) concerned may require 
assistance of specialist fraud examiners or investigators since Internal Auditors are not 
expected to have the expertise of a person whose primary responsibility is detecting 
and investigating fraud. 
Internal Audit will report any red flags in connection to fraud in its findings to the 
management during normal process of its activities.  
Internal Audit will also take into consideration the various policies like Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption policy, Code of Conduct, among others when reporting on any potential 
areas of fraud. 
 
Exceptions 
Any exceptions to the purpose, authority or responsibility of Internal Audit function 
must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee.

5. CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE SHAREHOLDERS MAY OR MAY NOT EXPECT 
DIVIDEND

distributed among shareholders and amount of profit to be retained in business. Hence, the shareholders of the 
Company may expect dividend only if the Company is having adequate profits after complying with all other 
statutory requirements under the Applicable Laws.

discretion of the Board: 
o 
in case of inadequacy of profits or whenever the Company has incurred losses;

of capital;

previous year losses or losses of its subsidiary/ies; and

the view that it would be prudent to conserve capital for the then ongoing or planned business expansion or other 
factors which may be considered by the Board. The statement of the Policy does not in any way restrict the right 
of the Board to use its discretion in the recommendation of the Dividend to be distributed in the financial year and 
the Board reserves the right to depart from the Policy as and when circumstances so warrant.Given the 
aforementioned uncertainties, prospective or present investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of 
the forward-looking statements in the Policy, if any.

Annexure A 
Policy for Determination of Legitimate Purposes Introduction 
This “Policy for Determination of Legitimate Purposes” hereinafter referred to as the “Policy” is prepared in 
accordance with Regulation 3(2A) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015 
Objective  
The objective of this policy is to identify ‘Legitimate Purposes’ for performance of duties or discharge of legal 
obligations, which will be considered as exception for procuring UPSI relating to the Company. The assessment 
of whether sharing of UPSI for a particular instance would tantamount to ‘legitimate purpose’ would depend on 
the specific facts and circumstances of each case. Accordingly, this Policy only sets out the principles that should 
be considered while assessing if the purpose for which UPSI is proposed to be shared is “legitimate”. Primarily, 
the following factors should be considered to determine the legitimate purpose:  
a. whether sharing of such information is in the ordinary course of business of the Company;  
 
b. whether information is sought to be shared to evade or circumvent the prohibitions of the Insider Trading 
Regulations;  
 
c. whether sharing the information is in the best interests of the Company or in furtherance of a genuine 
commercial purpose;  
 
d. whether the information is required to be shared for enabling the Company to discharge its legal and/or 
contractual obligations or performance of duties;  
 
e. whether the nature of information being shared is commensurate to the purpose for which access if sought 
to be provided to the recipient.  
It is clarified that in the event there exist multiple purposes for sharing UPSI, each purpose will be evaluated on 
its own merits, in line with the aforementioned principles.  
Digital Database  
A structured digital database shall be maintained containing the nature of UPSI and the names of such persons or 
entities with whom information is shared or who has shared such information along with the Permanent Account 
Number or any other identifier authorized by law where Permanent Account Number is not available. Such 
databases shall be maintained on the servers managed by the Company with adequate internal controls and checks 
such as time stamping and audit trails to ensure non-tampering of the database. This digital database should be 
preserved for a period of not less than eight years after completion of the relevant transactions. 
Restrictions on Communication and Trading by Insiders  
The Company shall inform the recipient of UPSI, by way of written intimation and/or contractual agreement, such 
as confidentiality agreement, that (i) the information being shared is UPSI and that the Company is the exclusive 
owner of such UPSI; (ii) upon receipt of UPSI, the recipient would be deemed to be an Insider and subject to the 
provisions of the Insider Trading Regulations, (iii) the recipient must maintain confidentiality of the UPSI at all 
times, (iv) the recipient may use the UPSI only for the approved purposes for which it was disclosed; (v) the 
recipient should provide a written undertaking that he/she/it shall not undertake trades in the securities of the 
Company while in possession of the UPSI; and (vi) the recipient must extend all co-operation to the Company, as 
may be required in this regard.

To prevent the misuse of confidential information the Company adopts a ‘Chinese Wall’ policy thereby 
separating those areas of the Company which routinely have access to confidential information, 
considered as ‘inside areas’ from those areas which deal with sale / marketing / investment advice or 
other departments providing support services, considered as ‘public areas’.  
  
The employees in the inside areas shall not communicate any UPSI to any one in public area. Demarcation 
of various departments as ‘inside area’ may be implemented by the Compliance Officer, in consultation 
with the Chief Financial Officer of the Company.  
  
In exceptional circumstances i.e. in furtherance of legitimate purposes, performance of duties or 
discharge of legal obligations, any Designated Person may be permitted to ‘cross the wall’ and give UPSI 
to any person on a ‘need to know’ basis, under intimation to the Compliance Officer.  
  
b) No insider shall communicate, provide, or allow access to any UPSI, relating to the Company or 
securities, to any person including other insiders except where such communication is in furtherance of

c) No person shall procure from or cause the communication by any insider of UPSI, relating to the 
Company or securities, except in furtherance of legitimate purposes, performance of duties or discharge 
of legal obligations.  
  
d) However, UPSI may be communicated, provided, allowed access to or procured, in connection with a 
transaction which:  
  
i. 
entails an obligation to make an open offer under the takeover regulations where the Board of the 
Company is of informed opinion that the proposed transaction is in the best interests of the 
Company; or  
 
ii. 
does not attract the obligation to make an open offer under the takeover regulations but where the 
Board of the Company is of the informed opinion that the proposed transaction is in the best interests 
of the Company and the information that constitutes UPSI is disseminated to be made generally 
available at least two trading days prior to the proposed transaction being effected in such form as 
the Board may determine to be adequate and fair to cover all relevant and material facts.  
  
e) For the above purposes, the Board shall require the parties to execute agreements to contract 
confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations on the part of such parties and such parties shall keep 
information so received confidential, except for the purpose of this clause and shall not otherwise trade 
in securities of the Company when in possession of UPSI.

security of login and password etc.

a) 
The Designated Person shall be entitled to formulate a trading plan and present it to the Compliance 
Officer for approval and may be carried public disclosure pursuant to which trades out on his behalf in

RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT POLICY 
 
1. PREAMBLE  
  
Pursuant to Regulation 17(9) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“SEBI Listing Regulations”) and Section 134(3) of the 
Companies Act, 2013, this Risk Assessment and Management Policy (“the Policy”) establishes the 
philosophy of One 97 Communications Limited (“Company”), towards risk identification, analysis 
and prioritization of risks, development of risk mitigation plans and reporting on the risk 
environment of the Company.  
 
The Policy is applicable to all the functions, departments and geographical locations of the 
Company. The purpose of this Policy is to define, design and implement a risk management 
framework across the Company to identify, assess, manage and monitor risks. Aligned to this 
purpose is also to identify potential events that may affect the Company and manage the risk 
within the risk appetite and provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the 
Company’s objectives. This will present a wide approach to ensure that key aspects of risk that 
have a wide impact are considered in its conduct of business.   
 
The Policy is adopted by the Board of Directors and shall be amended with their approval from 
time to time.   
 
2. DEFINITION AND OBJECTIVES  
 
Risk: Risk is an event which can prevent, hinder, or fail or otherwise obstruct, the enterprise in 
achieving its objectives. A business risk is the threat that an event or action will adversely affect an 
enterprise’s ability to maximize stakeholder value and to achieve its business objectives. Risk can 
cause financial disadvantage, for example, additional costs or loss of funds or assets. It can result 
in damage, loss of value and /or loss of an opportunity to enhance the enterprise operations or 
activities. Risk is the product of probability of occurrence of an event and the financial impact of 
such occurrence to an enterprise. 
 
The objective of this Policy is to manage the risks involved in all activities of the Company, to 
maximize opportunities and minimize adversity. This Policy is intended to assist in decision making 
processes that will minimize potential losses, improve the management of uncertainty and the 
approach to new opportunities, thereby helping the Company to achieve its objectives. The 
objectives of the Policy can be summarized as follows:   
  
a) To safeguard the Company’s and its subsidiaries’/ joint ventures’ property, interests, and 
interest of all stakeholders;  
b) To protect and enhance the corporate governance; 
c) To implement a process to identify potential / emerging risks; 

File: combined_policies, Page number: 145
 
Page | 3   
  
 
d) To manage risks with an institutionalized framework and consistently achieving desired 
outcomes;  
e) To implement appropriate risk management initiatives, controls, incident monitoring, reviews 
and continuous improvement initiatives;  
f) To minimize undesirable outcomes arising out of potential risks; and  
g) To align and integrate views of risk across the enterprise.  
  
  
  
3. COMPONENTS OF A SOUND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  
  
The risk management system in the Company comprises:  
  
a) Active board of directors, committee and senior management oversight;  
b) Appropriate policies, procedures and limits;  
c) Comprehensive and timely identification, measurement, mitigation, controlling, monitoring 
and reporting of risks;  
d) Comprehensive internal controls in accordance with current regulations and business size and 
scale;  
e) Appropriate management information systems at the business level; and  
f) A risk culture and communication framework  
  
4. RISK GOVERNANCE  
  
Risk governance signifies the way the business and affairs of an entity are directed and managed 
by its Board and executive management. The Company’s ability to conduct effective risk 
management is dependent upon having an appropriate risk governance structure and well-defined 
roles and responsibilities. The Policy thus provides the necessary framework for this purpose.  
 
5. RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  
  
The Risk Management Committee (RMC) formed by the Board shall periodically review the Policy 
and evaluate the risk management systems so that management controls the risk through a 
properly defined network.  
  
Heads of departments shall be responsible for implementation of the risk management system as 
may be applicable to their respective areas of functioning.  
  
6. RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE  
  
The Risk Management Committee shall have minimum three (3) members with majority of them 
being members of the Board of Directors, including at least two thirds of members of the Risk 

File: combined_policies, Page number: 146
 
Page | 4   
  
 
Management Committee shall comprise independent directors. The Chairperson of the Risk 
Management Committee shall be a member of the Board of Directors and senior executives of the 
Company may be members of the Risk Management Committee. 
 
The RMC shall meet on a quarterly basis. The quorum for a meeting of the Risk Management 
Committee shall be either two (2) members or one third of the members of the Risk Management 
Committee, whichever is higher, including at least one member of the Board of Directors in 
attendance.  
 
7. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS  
 
Conscious that no entrepreneurial activity can be undertaken without assumption of risks and 
associated 
reward 
opportunities, 
the 
Company 
operates 
on 
a 
risk 
management 
process/framework aimed at minimization of identifiable risks after evaluation so as to enable 
management to take informed decisions.  
  
Broad outline of the framework is as follows:  
  
a) Risk Identification: Management identifies potential events that may positively or negatively 
affect the Company’s ability to implement its strategy and achieve its objectives and 
performance goals. The categories of risk are identified by the Management and updated to 
the RMC on a periodic basis. An illustrative list of such risks is outlined in the Annexure.  
  
b) Root Cause Analysis: Undertaken on a consultative basis, root cause analysis enables tracing 
the reasons / drivers for existence of a risk element and helps developing appropriate 
mitigation action.  
  
c) Risk Scoring: Management considers qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate the 
likelihood and impact of identified risk elements. Likelihood of occurrence of a risk element 
within a finite time is scored based on polled opinion or from analysis of event logs drawn from 
the past. Impact is measured based on a risk element’s potential impact on revenue, profit, 
balance sheet, reputation, business and system availability etc. should the risk element 
materialize. The composite score of impact and likelihood are tabulated in an orderly fashion. 
The underlying model to arrive at the composite score for various categories of the risk shall be 
deployed internally in the Company in a graduated manner.  
 
The resultant “action required” is derived based on the combined effect of impact & likelihood 
and is quantified as per the subsequent paragraphs.  
  
d) Risk Categorization: The identified risks are further grouped in to (a) preventable; (b) strategic; 
and (c) external categories to homogenize risks.  
 

File: combined_policies, Page number: 147
 
Page | 5   
  
 
 Preventable risks are largely internal to the Company and are operational in nature. The 
endeavor is to reduce /eliminate the events in this category as they are controllable. 
Standard operating procedures and audit plans are relied upon to monitor and control such 
internal operational risks that are preventable.  
 
 Strategy risks are voluntarily assumed risks by the senior management in order to generate 
superior returns / market share from its strategy. Approaches to strategy risk is 
‘accept’/‘share’, backed by a risk-management system designed to reduce the probability 
that the assumed risks actually materialize and to improve the Company’s ability to manage 
or contain the risk events should they occur.  
 
 External risks arise from events beyond organization’s influence or control. They generally 
arise from natural and political disasters and major macroeconomic shifts. Management 
regularly endeavours to focus on their identification and impact mitigation through 
‘avoid’/‘reduce’ approach that includes measures like business continuity plan / disaster 
recovery management plan / specific loss insurance / policy advocacy etc.  
 
e) Risk Prioritization: Based on the composite scores, risks are prioritized for mitigation actions 
and reporting. 
  
f) Risk Mitigation Plan: Management develops appropriate responsive action on review of 
various alternatives, costs and benefits, with a view to managing identified risks and limiting 
the impact to tolerance level. Risk mitigation plan drives policy development as regards risk 
ownership, control environment timelines, standard operating procedure, etc.  
 
Risk mitigation plan is the core of effective risk management. The mitigation plan covers:  
 
 Required action(s);

management components and the quality of performance over time. Staff members are 
encouraged to carry out assessments throughout the year.

h) Options for dealing with risk: There are various options for dealing with risk.  
  
 Tolerate – If we cannot reduce the risk in a specific area (or if doing so is out of proportion 
to the risk) we can decide to tolerate the risk; i.e., do nothing further to reduce the risk. 
Tolerated risks are simply listed in the corporate risk register.  
 
 Transfer – Here risks might be transferred to other organizations, for example by use of 
insurance or transferring out an area of work.  
 
 Terminate – This applies to risks we cannot mitigate other than by not doing work in that 
specific area. So if a particular project is of very high risk and these risks cannot be mitigated 
we might decide to cancel the project.

actions undertaken/ proposed to be undertaken.

the General Circular No. 09/2023 dated 
September 25, 2023, issued by the MCA 
(“MCA Circulars”) and the various circulars

be the venue for the AGM.

Listing Regulations”) and the Circulars, the 
Company will be providing the facility of

AGM is being held through VC/ OAVM, 
physical attendance of the Members has 
been dispensed with. Accordingly, the

III.	 Other Information:
	
a)	 Reason of loss or inadequate profits:
	
	
The 
Company 
has 
invested 
in 
growing and strengthening the Paytm 
ecosystem through the acquisition 
and 
retention 
of 
consumers 
and 
merchants, providing them greater 
access to technology and financial 
services. In the quarter ended March 
2024, the average Monthly Transacting 
User (“MTU”) base reached 96 million, 
marking a 7% year-over-year increase. 
Additionally, the number of merchants 
paying 
for 
subscription 
payment 
devices rose to 10.7 million, up from 6.8 
million as of March 2023. The Company 
has made substantial investments in 
marketing and promotions, product 
and engineering talent, expanding the 
sales team, and providing devices and 
services to merchants.	
	
b)	 Steps taken or proposed to be taken 
for 
improvement 
and 
expected 
increase in productivity and profits in 
measurable terms: 
	
	
Focus on monetization along with control 
on costs has yielded strong results. For 
FY 2024, the EBITDA before ESOP cost 
was Rs 559 Cr as compared to Rs (176) 
Cr for FY 2023, while contribution margin 
improved from Rs 3,900 Cr to Rs 5,538 
Cr in the same period. While since then 
there were temporary disruptions in 
growth of revenue, and profitability due 
to RBI directive on our associate, Paytm 
Payments Bank Limited (‘’PPBL’’) on 
January 31, 2024, we have completed 
the transition of services from PPBL to 
other partners. This ensures that our 
existing customers and merchants will 
be able to use our services as before 
while also opening up more long-
term monetisation opportunities with 
the partner banks, given our strong 
customer and merchant engagement 
on the platform.
	
	
We are conducting a comprehensive 
review of our cost structure across 
all areas. We are creating a leaner 
organizational 
structure 
focused 
on 
enhancing 
performance 
and 
productivity. 
We 
will 
continue 
to 
enhance our merchant sales team 
and risk and compliance functions, 
Significant progress has been made in 
using AI to enhance cost efficiencies 
across our operations.

Letter to Shareholders
Dear Shareholders,
Last year has been one of the most significant learning experiences for us. We focused on generating 
free cash flow and delivered on that for the full year. We were also laser-focused on delivering profits 
after accounting for all costs, including ESOP costs, and we came very close to achieving that target. 
In the last quarter, we encountered regulatory action on our associate entity Paytm Payments 
Bank Limited (‘PPBL’), which presented significant challenges and provided us with many valuable 
lessons. I am very proud of our resilient Paytm team, who navigated this situation with courage, 
dedication and humility.
There are times when actions speak louder than words and results speak louder than plans. After 
resolving many of the challenges that we faced, we are now refocused on our path to deliver a 
long-term, sustainable and profitable business model. Our resilient and committed team will deliver 
on our mission to building for India. The focus on financial inclusion and digitizing the informal 
economy will bring long-term benefits to both the company and the country.
For me personally, this year has been centered on our core business, instilling a compliance-first 
approach in every team member, and striving to become a consistently free cash generating 
company. The Paytm team has identified significant savings through the use of AI and has expanded 
in areas where we see the future of technology heading.
I believe that AI will be as instrumental in advancing India as the mobile/smartphone revolution has 
been. Your company has always been a technology first company and will not only leverage AI-led 
cost savings but also build AI-first products that can help small merchants and micro-businesses 
harness the power of technology previously available only to large enterprises.
Helping and serving our nation is a privilege we do not take lightly. The entire Paytm team remains 
committed to delivering fully compliant, fully made-in-India innovations that bring millions of Indians 
the advantages of the formal financial system.
Thank you for your support and guidance.
Best,
Vijay Shekhar Sharma

Management Discussion and Analysis
Macroeconomic overview
Mobile payments in India have seen robust growth over the past decade, specially in the 
unorganised sector. We believe that there still remains ample scope to further deepen penetration, 
as consumers and businesses look to rapidly adopt affordable, secure and easy-to-use technology. 
With our world-class, technology-led, mobile-first payment and financial services, we strive to 
bring unserved and underserved Indian consumers and businesses to the mainstream economy. 
We enable merchants to accept a variety of payment options through our offerings such as QR 
codes, Soundboxes, EDC devices (card machines) and online payment gateway, and also help 
grow their businesses, by leveraging our app traffic and marketing services offerings. Consumers 
come to our app for the variety of payment use cases (such as P2P payments, merchant payments, 
mobile recharges, utility bills, etc) and the extensive range of payment options we offer.  
India continues to be one of the fastest growing economies globally and is estimated to attain 
8.2%(1) real GDP growth in FY24. The Reserve Bank of India has further raised India’s FY25 real GDP 
forecast to 7.2% from 7.0%(2), on prospects of improving rural and urban demand conditions. This 
puts India firmly on track to become a $7 trillion economy by 2030(3).
Industry overview and Outlook 
India’s payments landscape has benefitted from multiple developments over the past few years, 
be it innovations in mobile payments and digital infrastructure, continued regulatory support, or 
government initiatives to push for increased consumer and merchant acceptance. 
Given the increasing shift towards a cashless economy and user preference for transacting via their 
mobile phones, mobile payments continue to scale rapidly. This is further boosted by the growth 
of digital commerce and services. As a result, digital transactions in India have surpassed INR 3.2 
thousand lakh crore in FY 2023 and are expected to touch INR 4 thousand lakh crore by FY 2026.(4) 
Paytm is an integral part in the growth of mobile payments across the country. We offer a 
comprehensive suite of payment solutions to both consumers and merchants. This helps merchants 
expand their businesses using Paytm app traffic and also provides attractive cross-sell and up-
sell opportunities.

Management Discussion and Analysis

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 42
We believe that non-cash payments still remain under-penetrated in India, when compared to other 
countries. For instance, the value of card transactions (credit card + debit card) remains at c.8% of 
GDP in FY24. Including mobile payments such as UPI (P2M only), this ratio is c.25% (Source: RBI, 
NPCI) and is expected to grow multifold in the coming years.
The Indian Digital Lending market is expected to grow to $515 billion by 2030, growing at a 2021-
30E CAGR of 33%(5). The Indian WealthTech market will grow to $237 billion(5) by 2030 on the 
back of a growing base of retail investors, with the InsuranceTech market expected to reach $88 
billion(5) by 2030 driven by untapped opportunities and innovative models.
Our Business Model
Over the past year, in response to evolving industry landscape and regulations our business model 
has seen some changes, such as pausing small ticket credit (Paytm Postpaid), transition of UPI to 
multiple bank partners given the embargo on Paytm Payments Bank. This transition has helped de-
risk our business model and also opens up new opportunities for long-term monetization, given our 
platform’s strength around customer and merchant engagement. We continue to build a payment 
led ecosystem based on a comprehensive suite of payments services to consumers and merchants 
and leverage this ecosystem to distribute high margin financial services and marketing services.
Our payments business is an important customer and merchant acquisition tool for the platform. We 
enable merchants to accept a variety of payment options through our offerings such as QR codes, 
soundboxes, EDC devices and online payment gateway, and also help grow their businesses, by 
leveraging our app traffic and Marketing services offerings. Consumers come to our app for the 
variety of payment use cases (such as P2P payments, merchant payments, mobile recharges, utility 
bills, etc) as well as the comprehensiveness of available payment instruments. 
The large size of our ecosystem allows us to distribute high margin financial services such as 
credit, wealth management and insurance to our consumers and merchants. We also offer high 
margin Marketing Services use cases such as ticketing, gift vouchers, commerce to consumers and 
empower merchants to grow their business using services such as advertising and loyalty solutions.

Payment Services
On our app, consumers can use instruments such as cards, net banking, UPI and UPI Lite to make 
online payments for a variety of use cases. Consumers can also make online payments on mobile 
apps and in-store payments through QR codes and devices.
The increased adoption of payments use-cases has resulted in our Monthly Transacting Users 
(MTU) growing 16% YoY to 9.6 crore in FY 2024 from 8.2 crore in FY 2023

On the merchant side of our platform, we help our partners grow their businesses by providing 
solutions that allow them to accept payments through a wide variety of instruments and by 
deploying devices that help with reconciliations.
 
 
Small merchants can use QR codes, or use Soundbox devices which allow better reconciliation 
for merchants, hence enhancing their trust in mobile payments, and generating subscription 
revenues for us. The government also pays us incentive on certain types of transactions.
 
 
Our mid-sized and large retailers also use our POS devices which enables them to accept 
mobile and card payments, thus generating both MDR as well as subscription revenues for us.
 
 
For Online and Omni channel merchants we offer a robust payment gateway product, allowing 
merchants to reliably accept payments across all channels, which generates MDR revenue 
and platform fees.

Financial Services
Our Financial services offerings to consumers and merchants consist of innovative financial inclusion 
offerings like mobile credit, insurance, and wealth management for consumers and merchants.
Loan Distribution
As part of our loan distribution business, we operate a technology platform with capabilities across 
the entire loan lifecycle including origination, loan management and collection to provide credit 
access to our consumers and merchants through our financial institution partners. Our partners 
are able to work with Paytm to distribute products to customers who would have otherwise been 
harder to reach or service in a cost-effective manner. 
We distribute two types of loans (1) Loans where we also help the lenders with collection; (2) 
Distribution-only loans where our lending partner is responsible for the collections.
Our loan distribution business continues to scale providing attractive upsell revenues. Our lending 
partners disbursed loans of value H 52,390 Cr in FY 2024, a growth of 48% YoY from H 35,378 Cr in 
FY 2023. Out of the total disbursed loan value, H 25,264 Cr were disbursals from Postpaid loans, 
which have now been paused. 
Marketing Services 
To help our merchant partners grow their business by leveraging Paytm’s consumer traffic, we offer 
them marketing services like ability to sell tickets, deals and gift vouchers to customers. In addition, 
we also provide advertising, and loyalty services.
The distribution of co-branded credit cards also falls under our marketing services business. As 
of March 2024, we have a total of 1.2 million activated cards with SBI Card, HDFC Bank and Kotak 
Bank. We generate upfront revenue on card activation and receive a portion of the interchange fee

for the lifetime of the card. We see a strong runway for growth in this business, especially given the 
upsell potential to payments and loan distribution consumers.
Business Update and Outlook
In FY 2024, we achieved our first full year (since IPO) of EBITDA before ESOP profitability of H 
559 Cr, demonstrated strong revenue momentum (+25% YoY) and discipline around profitability 
(EBITDA margin up 8% YoY).
However, we were impacted by the RBI directive on our associate, Paytm Payment Bank Ltd (“PPBL”) 
in January 2024, which affected our scale of revenue and near-term profitability. With support from 
the Regulator, NPCI and our Bank partners, we have now successfully transitioned the services 
provided by PPBL to other partner banks which enables us to continue serving our customers and 
merchants uninterrupted. We believe this transition will further de-risk our business model and will 
open up more long-term monetisation opportunities with the partner banks, leveraging our strong 
customer and merchant engagement on the platform. 
Strong Revenue Momentum in FY 2024
We report our revenue under two lines, (i) Payment and Financial Services, and (ii) Marketing Services.

Payments business has two margin drivers - Payments 
processing margin and Subscriptions
In payment processing, we make a payment processing margin (i.e. revenues earned from processing 
payments less charges incurred on such transactions). We earn revenues on processing all kinds of 
payments, including those made with UPI (in the form of incentives from the government and MDR 
on payments made through Rupay Credit Card on UPI). 
Apart from earning revenues on processing payments, we also earn subscription revenue from 
merchants who use our payment devices, such as Soundbox and EDC machines. As of March 2024, 
our deployed payment devices increased to 107 lakh from 68 lakh in FY 2023, thus accelerating 
our subscription revenues. Merchants use our devices not only for accepting payments but also for 
fraud prevention and reconciliation services.

Net Payments Margin, defined as payments revenue (on payment processing as well as subscription 
revenue) less payment processing charges is a key indicator of profitability in this business. 
Payments profitability has improved over the years, with net payments margin growing 50% YoY to H 
2,955 Cr for FY 2024. Improvement in payment profitability is on account of increased monetization 
in the payments business as well as optimization of processing charges. 
Financial Services and Others
Financial Services and Others include revenues that we make from our financial services partners 
or consumers of our financial services offerings, primarily loan distribution. Revenue from financial 
services and others grew 30% to H 2,004 Cr in FY 2024 from H 1,540 Cr in FY 2023, primarily driven 
by 48% Y-o-Y growth in the value of loans processed in FY 2024 to H 52,390 Cr, from H 35,378 
Cr in FY 2023. We are also focusing on insurance broking and equity broking. In addition, we are 
expanding distribution of mutual funds where we see strong tailwinds in terms of participation of 
the retail investors in the equity markets.

our employee expenses have grown 34% to H 3,124 Cr in FY 2024 from H 2,323 Cr in FY 2023 with 
investments primarily in technology, merchants sales and financial services. Our software, cloud and 
data center expenses have declined 7% YoY to H 643 Cr in FY 2024 from H 694 Cr in FY 2023 driven 
by optimisations in cloud costs. This is a result of our indigenously developed payments technology 
platform, which is upgraded with new-age technological solutions and equipped with faster speed 
and higher security. Other direct expenses grew 24% from H 485 Cr in FY 2023 to H 600 Cr in FY 2024, 
primarily due to increase in device refurbishment expenses and provisions for doubtful debt.
We are optimizing our cost structure, leveraging AI capabilities, and focusing on our core business 
will enable us to achieve significant cost efficiencies. This includes creating a leaner organization 
structure and pruning non-core businesses.
For the coming year, while we continue to invest in the merchant sales team, as well as risk and 
compliance functions, we expect reductions in other employee costs. We expect annualized people 
cost savings of H 400 - H 500 Cr.

Drivers for Growth and Opportunities
Our ecosystem allows us to address large and fast growing market opportunities: As India’s leading 
mobile ecosystem for consumers and merchants, we have built the largest payments ecosystem 
in terms of number of consumers and merchants. Customers use various payment services on 
our platform, and merchants use us to accept payments and grow their business. We also provide 
financial services through our financial institution partners, particularly loan distribution. Payments 
is a universal need for consumers and merchants, and provides us an attractive way of acquiring, 
retaining and monetising customers and merchants. It continues to give us very high engagement, 
and in addition, we believe we can make substantial revenues and profits in payments. Mobile 
distribution of credit is a massive and scalable profit pool in India. Our ecosystem allows us to 
address these multiple large and fast growing market opportunities at scale and gives us multiple 
growth vectors.
Our business model creates sustainable advantages for us: We believe that our brand, distribution, 
insights, technology skills, and the scope of our ecosystem give us an advantage to grow our 
business through, (i) cost-effective acquisition of consumers and merchants; (ii) reinforce our 
platform by building higher engagement and stickiness with consumers and merchants; and (iii) 
build high monetisation products at low cost of acquisition.
Our product and technology DNA: Our technology stack is built ground up and integrated across 
all aspects of our ecosystem. This allows us to integrate our payments offering seamlessly with 
other offerings. Similarly, for financial services, our technology infrastructure is built on a stack that 
is owned, controlled and written by us and our subsidiaries. Our technology ownership and scope 
of our ecosystem has allowed us (and and financial institution partners) to offer services such 
as Paytm QR, Paytm Soundbox, Gold investments, Personal Loans and Merchant Cash Advance. 
All of these products aim to improve the experience of consumers and merchants who use it 
in our ecosystem.
Enabling regulatory environment: In our view, the regulatory environment in India remains 
constructive and supportive of digital payments and financial services. RBI in its Payments Vision 
2025  has reinforced the themes of enabling growth of digital payments across multiple instruments 
including UPI and cards. Regulatory compliance remains a key focus for us as an organization. 
Internal Control Systems and Risk Management Framework
In a rapidly evolving business, technical and regulatory environment coupled with dynamic consumer 
demands and growing competition, our risk profile is also evolving constantly. Our Company is 
cognizant that effective risk management is core to a sustainable business. We have therefore 
adopted a dynamic risk management framework that functions under the oversight of our Audit 
Committee and Risk Management Committee.

Anti-money laundering and Counter-terrorism Financing Risk Management: To ensure clean 
day-to-day operations, we have instituted comprehensive on-boarding and risk management 
practices, which include appropriate anti-money laundering policies and procedures.
Investments and Acquisitions Risk Management: To ensure that our investments and acquisitions 
are strategically complementary to our business, we have an identified team of professionals who 
manage our portfolio in alignment with the Company’s growth plans.
Business and Operational Risks
Macro economic environment: We continue to monitor and adapt to any macro-economic condition 
that affects our customers and merchants as it could also have an impact on our business. We will 
continue to do all that is necessary and in our control in such scenarios. 
Financial: We continue to focus on improving profitability while making disciplined investments in 
areas such as expanding our products and services, broadening our marketing and promotional 
activities to acquire and retain customers and merchants. There could be growth in expenses as 
we continue to expand our business operations. 
Pace of technology innovation: We make significant investments to constantly improve the 
scale, stability and functionality of our technology. Failure to maintain best-in-class technology 
infrastructure could harm our business and prospects.
Cybersecurity: Our platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for business continuity and 
to manage cybersecurity risks and data security breaches. We use analytics and machine learning 
to ensure optimum automated fraud detection during transaction processing. Encrypted data 
transmission using security protocols and algorithms ensures confidentiality and prevents leakage 
of confidential customer data. Data and technology infrastructures are vulnerable to cyber attacks, 
as any such incident could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business. 
Regulatory: We are extremely focused on ensuring compliance with the statutory and regulatory 
framework, and are continuously strengthening our compliance processes and management depth 
as some of our businesses are subject to a fast evolving regulatory landscape. 
Competition: We consistently invest in enhancing our platform and customer-centric services 
in order to maintain our leadership. Our industry is extremely competitive, and consumers and 
merchants have multiple options. 
Litigation: We have a dedicated team to manage litigation risk and engage external consultants where 
necessary, thereby ensuring minimum impact of materiality. As a Company (or key management) 
we may be subject to legal proceedings, including ongoing litigation in tax, civil or other matters.

Paytm is committed to sustainability and is dedicated to ESG. The company’s sustainability efforts 
include reducing its carbon footprint, promoting financial inclusion, and supporting local communities.

the reliance on cash transactions. By providing a seamless and secure digital payment experience, 
Paytm has contributed to greater financial inclusion and transparency, reducing the environmental 
impact associated with the production and circulation of physical currency. Products like Soundbox 
devices allow better reconciliation for merchants, hence enhancing their trust in digital payments.
Financial Inclusion: Paytm has been instrumental in promoting financial inclusion by providing 
access to financial services to individuals who were previously unserved. Through its services, 
Paytm has enabled people to send, and receive money digitally, empowering them economically 
and reducing inequalities.
Paytm’s commitment to ESG principles goes beyond its business operations. The company actively 
engages in social and environmental initiatives to drive positive change. It supports various social 
causes, including education, healthcare, and disaster relief.

of the initiative is on building and establishing computer labs, and other educational facilities like 
e-libraries to create a conducive learning environment for students.
Paytm Foundation donated laptops and desktops and created an impact in the lives of more than 
7,500 students. These digital equipment were used to equip children with essential life skills and 
vocational training, empowering them for better opportunities in the future. Encouraged by the 
success of this initiative, we have plans to further expand this initiative, which aims to bridge the 
digital divide faced in the country. 
Creating Awareness of Digital Financial Platforms 
Through our partnerships with Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) for training programs, we have 
successfully trained over 5,000 officials so far. The programs are designed to help Investigation 
agencies, such as state police, cyber cell, and CID, to understand the overall financial ecosystem, 
covering topics like payments processing, typical frauds in cyber crime domain. We also inform them 
about safety measures we have built to prevent fraud on our platform. So far we have conducted 
over 100 sessions across more than 20 states in the country.

Dear Members,
The Board of Directors (“Board”) hereby submits the 24th Annual Report on the business and 
operations of One 97 Communications Limited (“Company” or “Our” or “We” or “Paytm”) together 
with the Audited Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year ended 
March 31, 2024 (“FY 2023-24”). Wherever required, the consolidated performance of the Company 
and its subsidiary(ies) has also been provided.
Financial Performance	
The standalone and consolidated financial highlights of the Company’s operations are 
summarised below:

State of Affairs of the Company / 
Operational Highlights
Your Company continued expansion of its 
payments and financial services businesses 
during FY 2023-24. Our payments business 
is 
our 
acquisition 
engine 
which 
brings 
customers to our platform. We monetize these 
customers by cross selling various financial & 
marketing services. 
As a result of the Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) direction to Paytm Payments Bank 
Limited (“PPBL”) our associate Company, on 
January 31, 2024, Paytm has become a Third-
Party Application Provider (“TPAP”) for the UPI 
channel, partnering with Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, 
State Bank of India and YES Bank. The Company 
has transitioned users of the @paytm handle to 
new bank handles—@pthdfc, @ptaxis, @ptsbi, 
or @ptyes—ensuring seamless UPI payments. 
We have now partnered with various banks for 
existing and new UPI customers and merchants, 
card acquiring and Bank Identification Number 
sponsorship for card acceptance offering 
to merchants, nodal/escrow accounts for 
merchant fund settlement, FasTag distribution 
and BBPS. This will open up more long-term 
monetisation opportunities with the partner 
banks, given our strong customer and merchant 
engagement on the platform.
Key aspects of our Company’s consolidated 
performance during FY 2023-24 are as follows: 
 
 
The Company achieved its first full year of 
operating profitability, with EBITDA before 
ESOP of H 559 Cr (including UPI Incentives), 
driven by 25% YoY revenue growth and 
expansion of contribution margin. With 
recent disruptions, there has been a steady 
state annualised EBITDA impact of around 
H 500 Cr owing to discontinuation of PPBL 
offerings such as wallet and FasTag. Our 
average monthly transacting users for the 
quarter ended March 2024 were 9.6 Cr, up 
by 7% YoY from 9.0 Cr; driven by variety of 
use cases that we offer, as mobile payments 
adoption for consumers and merchants in 
India continues to grow.
 
 
Subscription services for payment devices, 
such as Soundbox and POS machines, 
is also witnessing strong adoption, with 
1.07 Cr merchants paying us subscriptions 
as of March 2024, a significant increase from  
68 lakhs as of March 2023.
 
 
Our loan distribution business, in partnership 
with our lending partners, continues to 
scale with loans amounting to H 52,390 Cr, 
a YoY growth of 48%.
 
 
Gross merchandise volume of payments 
facilitated through our platform for the year 
ended March 31, 2024 has grown 38% YoY 
to H 18.34 Lakh Cr from H 13.22 Lakh Cr for 
the year ended March 31, 2023. 
The growth of UPI and other mobile payment 
methods presents a wealth of untapped 
opportunities. In March 2024, we received 
approval from National Payments Corporation 
of India (NPCI) to participate in UPI as a TPAP 
under 
multi-bank 
model. 
Our 
pioneering 
innovation, 
Paytm 
Soundbox, 
has 
been 
groundbreaking for our merchants. Our device 
has seen a rapid adoption across the country 
and played a vital role in empowering small 
and micro-businesses in India. It supports 
11 languages including English and Regional 
Languages. In order to serve the diverse needs 
of our growing merchant base, we continue to 
launch innovative products, like Card Soundbox

(enabling merchants to accept mobile and card 
payments), Pocket Soundbox (a small card-
sized device which easily fits in the pocket and 
is helpful for merchants on the go, including 
auto drivers, delivery agents, parking fee 
collectors etc.) and Music Soundbox (allowing 
merchants to listen to music over Bluetooth 
speaker, improving their engagement).
During this period, as disclosed on March 1, 2024, 
Paytm and PPBL undertook additional measures 
to pursue independent future plans and mutually 
agreed to discontinue various inter-company 
agreements with Paytm and its group entities. 
Also, the shareholders of PPBL have agreed 
to simplify the Shareholders Agreement to 
support PPBL’s governance. Further, PPBL has 
reconstituted its Board of Directors to be fully 
independent, with the appointment of various 
Independent Directors and a new Chairman. 
Paytm supports the direction of independent 
future plans for PPBL and has accordingly 
withdrawn its nominee from PPBL’s Board of 
Directors. Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma has also 
resigned from the Board of Directors of PPBL to 
enable this transition.

Conservation of Energy and 
Technology Absorption 
Energy Conservation:
The Company’s operations are not energy 
intensive. 
However, 
the 
Company 
has 
implemented 
various 
energy 
conservation 
measures, such as adopting good practices in 
all major offices for energy conservation like 
the use of LED lights, ban on one-time use 
plastic, energy-efficient appliances, sensor-
based water faucets and sensor-based lighting 
systems in toilets.
The corporate office building of the Company 
is an Indian Green Building Council Platinum 
certified building and is primarily focused on 
developing sustainable sites, increased water 
and energy efficiency, reduced waste and 
emissions, use of eco-friendly building materials, 
and improving indoor environmental quality 
more efficiently than conventional designs like 
energy-efficient windows, LED lighting, energy-
efficient appliances, geothermal heat pumps, 
and energy efficient insulation. 
Further, in most of our facilities, VRV/VRF air-
conditioned systems are installed that are 
second generation energy efficient products. 
We have also installed VAV controllers in all 
meeting rooms & floors to maintain the required 
cooling as per floor occupancy, which ultimately 
reduces the overall load of the air handling 
unit and chiller. Heat resistant facade glasses 
have been installed all across the building that 
restricts the heat & maintains the temperature on 
the floor, which also facilitates the natural light 
throughout the day. All electrical appliances that 
we are sourcing for the office are 5* (star) rated 
for higher energy efficiency. We have a BMS 
(Building Management System) for controlling 
and monitoring energy conservation.
The other conservation measures undertaken by 
the Company during FY 2023-24 are mentioned 
in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report, which forms part of the Annual Report.

Share Transfer System
During FY 2023-24, the RTA of the Company ensured compliance with all the procedural 
requirements with respect to transfer, transmission and transposition of shares and formalities 
with respect to name deletion, sub-division, consolidation, renewal, exchange and endorsement of 
share certificates.
SEBI vide its Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/POD-1/P/CIR/2024/37 dated May 07, 2024 read 
with other applicable circulars, from time to time, if any, mandated all the listed companies to issue 
securities in dematerialised form only, while processing the service request for issue of duplicate 
securities certificates, renewal/exchange of securities certificate, claim from Unclaimed Suspense 
Account, endorsement, sub-division/ splitting of securities certificate, consolidation of securities 
certificates/folios, transmission and transposition. Accordingly, the Company / its RTA are not 
accepting any lodgement of transfer of shares in physical form. Members holding shares in physical 
form are advised to avail the facility of dematerialisation. However, investors are not barred from 
holding shares in physical form. Transfers in electronic form are much simpler and quicker as the 
members have to approach their respective depository participants and the transfers are processed 
by NSDL/ CDSL, as the case may be, with no requirement of any separate communication to be 
made to the Company.
Shareholders holding more than 1% of the shares as on March 31, 2024

the format prescribed vide SEBI Master Circular

liabilities are denominated in a currency other 
than the functional currency of the Company.
During FY 2023-24, the Company did not 
undertake any derivative hedging activity and 
managed its foreign exchange risk through a 
mix of close monitoring, management review 
and natural hedge.

1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such 
consultations provided to the Board. 
We have implemented a strategic approach for stakeholder identification, prioritization, and 
engagement, synchronous with our ongoing efforts to implement our ‘Stakeholder Engagement 
Policy.’ This policy is meticulously designed to outline the purpose, scope, engagement plan, 
and communication details, all aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability. Throughout 
the year, our continuous engagement and regular interactions empower our teams to gather 
valuable feedback and information. This input is then shared with the senior management and 
reported to our ESG Committee for further review and action.
Our ESG Committee, operating under the guidance of the CSR Committee, plays a pivotal role 
in ensuring adherence to our ESG standards. This committee holds overall responsibility for 
effectively guiding, directing, and overseeing the Company’s ESG-related progress. Periodically, 
the ESG Committee presents its findings to the CSR Committee, which in turn offers necessary 
recommendations to the Board and management on pertinent matters.
The responsibilities of the ESG Committee encompass a range of tasks, including approving, 
noting, and ratifying ESG goals, targets, and strategies. Additionally, they consult on ESG 
related stakeholder matters, monitor performance, oversee the execution of ESG initiatives, and 
ensure alignment with long-term ESG commitments and targets. Encompassing various ESG 
dimensions such as energy, water, waste, human rights, and supply chain, the ESG Committee 
also oversees material ESG risks and opportunities, actively seeking to mitigate risks while 
considering their financial implications.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the 
inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities 
of the entity.  
Yes, in the fiscal year 2023-24, guided by stakeholder consultations, we have begun 
implementing new policies developed in alignment with material topics and NGRBC principles. 
Furthermore, we have established an ESG committee and conducted financial inclusion 
sessions for women, along with a health and safety session for vendors.
We rely on internal stakeholder consultation for the identification and management of environmental 
and social topics. Additionally, to align our material topics with our business strategy and bring 
independence, we engaged an external consultant during the financial year, to gain comprehensive 
insights into emerging trends and best practices. In alignment with the sectoral guidance of leading 
ESG frameworks and indices, relevant material topics were identified and further refined.

The insights garnered from both internal consultations and external assessments have helped 
us craft our ESG strategy, in line with identified topics. New policies developed in alignment 
with the identified material topics and NGRBC principles are currently in the implementation 
phase. These identified topics shall serve as the foundation around which our strategy is built, 
and throughout the year, our ESG activities, targets and performance metrics across various 
departments will be developed accordingly.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.  
We recognize the importance of giving back to society, and our company actively engages 
on various aspects of social and community development across India, in collaboration with 
numerous nonprofits to address the concerns of vulnerable/marginalized stakeholder groups. 
Aligned with our ‘CSR policy,’ which outlines the process of execution, utilization, monitoring, 
among others, our company focuses on addressing the concerns of these stakeholder groups. 
We continuously identify opportunities to improve the lives of the disadvantaged, vulnerable, 
and marginalized stakeholders through our ongoing CSR engagements.
Through one of our flagship educational CSR initiatives, Shikshit Bharat, we aim to bridge 
the digital gap between rural and urban areas, leveraging the pivotal role of technology in 
fostering equitable development. Via this program, we have distributed 186 laptops and 33 
desktops to schools, nonprofits, and government bodies, primarily targeting the women in rural 
areas, providing digital tools to overcome educational, employment, and economic barriers, 
empowering them towards independence. Also, in collaboration with the Scaler Foundation, 
Paytm extended a scholarship to 24 underprivileged engineering students in Bangalore, aiming 
to support their higher education.
We also conducted comprehensive financial literacy sessions as part of our volunteering 
activities. These sessions have reached over 1000 women representing diverse organizations, 
delving into fundamental principles of finance management. By equipping participants with 
essential knowledge and skills, we empower them to navigate the intricacies of finance with 
confidence. Moreover, our employee volunteering efforts encompass 179 volunteers dedicating 
their time, benefiting a total of 5001 individuals, and accumulating a remarkable total of 1342 
volunteering hours.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and 
harassment cases. 
As mentioned in our Code of Conduct, the Company and all its affiliate Companies shall 
provide equal opportunities to all its employees/Personnel and all qualified applicants for 
employment without regard to their race, caste, religion, colour, ancestry, marital status, work 
experience, gender, sexual orientation, age, nationality, ethnic origin or disability. We have 
adopted policies which reinforce to the stakeholders, who raise complaints on a concrete and 
reasonable belief about a violation, that they will not be subjected to any kind of retaliation 
such as discrimination, reprisal, harassment, victimization etc. irrespective of the concern 
being ultimately substantiated. 
The Company has zero tolerance for any kind of harassment and discrimination. Our Human 
Resource policies and Code of Conduct promote diversity and equality in the workplace, as 
well as compliance with all local labour laws, while encouraging the adoption of international 
best practices.
Employee policies and practices are administered in a manner consistent with applicable laws 
and other provisions of the Code of Conduct, respect for the right to privacy and the right to 
be heard, and that in all matters equal opportunity is provided to those eligible and decisions 
are based on merit.
In addition, the POSH Policy has been formed under the provisions of the Sexual Harassment of 
Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, to prohibit, prevent or 
deter the commission of acts of sexual harassment at workplace and to provide the procedure 
for the redressal of complaints pertaining to sexual harassment. In case any allegations of sexual 
harassment are substantiated by the ICC, appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken against 
the accused. Disciplinary action may include transfer, withholding promotion, suspension or 
even dismissal. This action shall be in addition to any legal recourse sought by the complainant. 
The Company also has a whistle blower mechanism that empowers its employees to raise 
the concerns, if any, for instances like bribery, suspicion of corruption, behavioral issues, 
discrimination etc. via this vigil mechanism. Complaints reported to any internal stakeholder 
(reporting manager/ HR team/ Compliance Officer) of any potential violation are channelized 
to the whistle blowing mechanism. The identity of the complainants is kept confidential during 
the investigation. The Company has enabled the web portal “Navex Global” to take anonymous 
complaints and facilitate reporting of the protected disclosures routed through the web links, 
toll-free number and application access mentioned in detail on the Intranet, Deep Purple. The 
Company investigates all the complaints reported under the whistle blowing mechanism after 
the due approval from a member of the Disciplinary Action Committee in a timely manner. The 
investigating team ensures compliance with all the regulatory requirements during the course of 
investigation. After the completion of the investigation, a report is submitted with recommended 
measures to the Disciplinary Action Committee. The Disciplinary Action Committee initiates

The organization on a regular basis sensitizes its employees on the prevention of sexual 
harassment at the workplace through workshops, group meetings, online training modules and 
awareness programmes.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then

We are proud to represent our nation on the global stage, actively advocating for sustainable 
practices. Since December 2017, our Founder & CEO, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, has been serving 
as the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) advocate  for Clean Air. He has been 
instrumental in driving environmental action and awareness, championing UNEP’s global 
#BreatheLife campaign, which focuses on improving air quality and influencing policy and 
citizen action for a healthier future.
In collaboration with UNEP, our CSR arm, Paytm Foundation, launched the Air Quality Action 
Forum (AQAF) last financial year. This national-level forum brings together regulators, national 
and international philanthropic organisations, international development agencies, and 
the corporate sector. The goal is to identify needs, gaps, and solutions to India’s air quality 
problems, ensuring structured project implementation with a yearly action plan. AQAF facilitates 
an inclusive approach to tackling air pollution through stakeholder engagement.
Vijay also serves on the Advisory Board of the Green Digital Finance Alliance. This Alliance 
explores the potential for digital finance and fintech innovations to reshape the financial system 
in alignment with sustainable development goals. Our initiatives, such as reducing paper 
usage by promoting digital transactions and e-receipts, reflect our commitment to conserving 
resources and reducing pollution.
Paytm’s ‘Box of Joy’ initiative epitomises purposeful gifting with environmental consciousness 
and community engagement. Central to this initiative is the ‘Vriksharopan’ project, where Paytm 
pledges to plant two trees for each employee in the newly established Paytm Forest near the 
National Capital Region (NCR), in collaboration with the Sankalptaru Foundation. This afforestation 
effort addresses environmental concerns and contributes to socio-economic empowerment by 
providing livelihood opportunities to local communities responsible for nurturing these trees.
Each tree planted under the ‘Box of Joy’ initiative is geotagged, allowing employees to monitor 
their growth and visit the site. This deepens their connection with nature and reinforces 
Paytm’s dedication to community welfare and environmental sustainability. This comprehensive 
approach exemplifies how Paytm seamlessly integrates joy, environmental stewardship, and 
social responsibility into its operational framework.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
The Company's operations do not involve the use of hazardous or toxic chemicals. In managing 
electronic waste (e-waste) responsibly, the Company has implemented comprehensive 
systems across all its facilities in India. Our dedication to environmental stewardship extends 
to the handling of e-waste assets, which undergo a structured disposal process. We strictly 
adhere to our comprehensive E-Waste Policy, ensuring the proper management of e-waste 
resulting from our business operations. To uphold these standards, we collaborate with e-waste 
vendors approved by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), guaranteeing responsible 
and compliant e-waste handling practices across our operations.
The Company has also devised a comprehensive waste collection strategy in accordance with 
the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to the CPCB. To efficiently manage 
other forms of waste, the Company segregates and stores generated waste into two distinct 
categories: dry waste and wet waste, utilizing appropriate bins for this purpose. All waste 
generated on our premises is managed through our partnerships with government-authorized 
agencies equipped with sorting and processing facilities.

completed 
through 
Paytm-

The Company has formulated a comprehensive disaster management plan to delineate the 
protocols to be followed in the event of natural or man-made emergencies, political unrest, 
or criminal activities that could disrupt business operations and escalate into emergency 
situations. This plan outlines the specific procedures to be enacted during such occurrences.
	
The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) documentation encompasses the following 
key components:
 
 
Establishment of an Emergency Response Team (ERT): Comprising individuals trained to 
prepare for and respond to emergency incidents, the ERT addresses a wide spectrum 
of potential crises, including natural disasters and industrial accidents. Through ongoing 
training and awareness-building exercises, the ERT enhances preparedness and 
response capabilities.
 
 
Deployment of a Quick Response Team (QRT): Operating round-the-clock as the initial 
responders, the QRT comprises a designated driver and two Civil Defence Volunteers 
skilled in firefighting, search and rescue, and first aid. During emergencies such as 
fires, the Emergency Coordinator assumes primary responsibility for coordinating 
staff response efforts and liaising with external emergency services. Additionally, the 
Emergency Coordinator oversees the training and designation of QRT members in fire 
prevention techniques.

Customer and merchant care
The Company recommends customers and merchants to carefully go through the help pages 
that provide self-help. For queries and concerns that are not addressed through the help pages, 
the customers and merchants can contact the care team through the Paytm App and Paytm 
for Business App.

Our in-app support channel is able to resolve a vast majority of customer complaints. In any 
uncommon scenario, where one wishes to escalate the concern to the next level, one needs to 
ensure that they have already exhausted the previous level(s) and their concern remains un-
resolved or not resolved to their satisfaction. This is not a channel but a reactive means to address 
those who raise concerns on social media.

The 
assurance 
activities 
were 
carried 
out together with a desk review as per 
reporting boundary.
Limitations
TUVI did not perform any assurance procedures 
on the prospective information disclosed in 
the Report, including targets, expectations, 
and ambitions. Consequently, TUVI draws no 
conclusion on the prospective information. 
During the assurance process, TUVI did not come 
across any limitation to the agreed scope of the 
assurance engagement. TUVI did not verify any 
ESG goals and claim through this assignment. 
TUVI disclaims any liability or co-responsibility 
1) for any decision a person or an entity would 
make based on this assurance statement and 
2) for any damages in case of erroneous data is 
reported. While, TUVI verified data with maximum 
sample desired for limited level of assurance; the 
responsibility for the authenticity of submitted 
data entirely lies with ‘Paytm’. TUVI has taken 
reference of the financial figures from the audited 
financial statements. ‘Paytm’ will be responsible 
for the appropriate application of the financial 
data. The application of this assurance statement 
is limited w.r.t SEBI circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-
SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122, dated Jul 12, 2023).
Water
1.	
The raw water consumption at the 50 fleet 
offices is estimated based on the studies 
provided by the per day per employee 
water consumption as per CWGA studies.
Waste
1.	
The waste data was not monitored for the 
50 fleet offices; thus, the reported waste 
values are limited to the 20 regional offices.
2.	 The generated non-hazardous waste in 
the 20 regional offices is handed over to 
the land lord. Thus, traceability to disposal 
method is missing. Thus, all generated non-
hazardous waste is thus conservatively 
assumed to be landfilled.
Our Responsibility
TUVI's 
responsibility 
in 
relation 
to 
this 
engagement is to perform a limited level of 
assurance and to express a conclusion based 
on the work performed. Our engagement did not 
include an assessment of the adequacy or the 
effectiveness of Paytm's strategy, management 
of ESG-related issues or the sufficiency of 
the Report against BRSR reporting principles, 
other than those mentioned in the scope of the 
assurance. TUVI's responsibility regarding this 
verification is in reference to the agreed scope 
of work, which includes assurance of non-
financial quantitative and qualitative information 
(09 attributes as per Annexure I - Format of 
BRSR Core) disclosed by ‘Paytm’. Reporting

This assurance statement is prepared by 
considering that the data and information 
presented 
by 
‘Paytm' 
are 
free 
from 
material misstatement.
Verification Methodology
During the assurance engagement, TUVI 
adopted a risk-based approach, focusing on 
verification efforts with respect to disclosures. 
TUVI has verified the disclosures and assessed 
the 
robustness 
of 
the 
underlying 
data 
management system, information flows, and 
controls. In doing so:
a)	 TUVI 
examined 
and 
reviewed 
the 
documents, data, and other information 
made available by Paytm for 09 attributes 
as per Annexure I - Format of BRSR Core 
(non-financial disclosures) followed by 
taking reference of the financial figures 
from the audited financial statement,
b)	 TUVI 
conducted 
interviews 
with 
key 
representatives, including data owners 
and 
decision-makers 
from 
different 
functions of ‘Paytm’,
c)	 TUVI performed sample-based reviews 
of the mechanisms for implementing the 
sustainability-related policies and data 
management (qualitative and qualitative),
d)	 TUVI reviewed the adherence to reporting 
requirements of BRSR Core framework.
Opportunities for Improvement
The 
following 
are 
the 
opportunities 
for 
improvement reported to ‘Paytm’. However, 
they are generally consistent with Paytm 
management's 
objectives 
and 
programs. 
Paytm already identified below topics and 
Assurance team endorse the same to achieve 
the Sustainable Goals of organization:
a)	 The Reporting organization can develop the 
SOP for reporting the 09 CORE attributes,
b)	 The reporting organization can perform the 
internal audits of the sustainability data on 
periodic basis,
c)	 The reporting organization can develop the 
traceable method for diversion of its non-
Hazardous Waste from the landfill,
d)	 The reporting organization can perform the 
water audits and evaluate the method to 
monitor the raw water consumption at the 
50 fleet offices,
e)	 The reporting organization can develop the 
method to capture the waste related data 
for the 50 fleet offices.
Conflict of Interest
In the context of BRSR requirements set by 
SEBI, addressing conflict of interest is crucial 
to maintain high integrity and independence 
of assurance engagements. As per SEBI 
guidelines, 
assurance 
providers 
need 
to 
disclose any potential conflict of interest 
that could compromise the independence or 
neutrality of their assessments. TUVI diligently 
identifies any relationships, affiliations, or 
financial interests that could potentially cause 
conflict of interest. We proactively implement 
measures to mitigate or manage these conflicts, 
ensuring independence and impartiality in our 
assurance engagements. We provide clear and 
transparent disclosures about any identified 
conflicts of interest in our assurance statement. 
We recognize that failure to address conflict 
of interest adequately could undermine the 
Statutory Reports

creditability of the assurance process and the 
reliability of the reported information. Therefore, 
we strictly adhere to SEBI guidelines and take 
necessary measures to avoid, disclose, or 
mitigate conflicts of interest effectively.

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
(a)	 Assessment of impairment in carrying value of investment in Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL) 
(Refer accompanying notes 6 & 41 to the Standalone Financial Statements)
The Company is a 39% shareholder in Paytm 
Payments Bank Limited (“PPBL”), which is treated 
as an associate entity of the Company.
On January 31, 2024, the RBI issued a Press 
Release, imposing significant restrictions on the 
business operation of PPBL and permitted only 
withdrawal/ utilization of the available balances by 
customers from their accounts. 
Considering the uncertainties pertaining to the 
above RBI notice on the underlying recoverable 
value of its investments, the management performed 
an impairment assessment on the carrying value of 
investment in PPBL. Such assessment was primarily 
on the basis of qualitative factors in light of the RBI 
press release, such as, the scaled down business 
operations of PPBL and its business prospects 
including restrictions affecting normal operations 
of the primary products such as wallet, likelihood of 
any regulatory developments. 
Based on the foregoing, the Company recorded an 
impairment loss of Rs 2,096 Mn, representing the 
entire residual carrying amount of the Company’s 
investment in PPBL.
Considering the inherent complexities and significant 
judgements involved, the assessment of above 
impairment was considered as a key audit matter.
Our procedures included the following:
 
 
We have read the Press Release and related 
FAQs issued by RBI in relation to imposition 
of 
significant 
restrictions 
on 
business 
operation of PPBL. 
 
 
We 
discussed 
with 
the 
Company’s 
management to obtain their understanding of 
the potential implication of the restrictions on 
the operation of PPBL, Tested the arithmetical 
accuracy of the equity accounting up to March 
31, 2024 and impairment loss recognised by 
the Company in respect of PPBL.
 
 
We 
obtained 
and 
read 
management 
assessment pertaining to impairment of its 
investment in PPBL. 
 
 
Tested 
the 
arithmetical 
accuracy 
of 
impairment loss.
 
 
We assessed adequacy of relevant disclosures 
as per applicable Ind AS.
Assessment of recoverable value of investment in subsidiaries and other associates (Refer accompanying 
notes 5 & 6 to the Standalone Financial Statements)
The 
Company 
has 
investments 
in 
various 
subsidiaries and other associates. Where an 
indication of impairment exists, the carrying value 
of an investment is assessed for impairment as per 
Ind AS 36 and where applicable an impairment loss 
is recognized. 
Our procedures included the following:
 
 
We evaluated the Company’s assessment for 
identification of indicators of impairment.
 
 
We obtained an understanding from the 
management, assessed and tested the design 
and operating effectiveness of the Company’s 
key controls over the impairment assessment 
including determination of recoverable value.

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The determination of recoverable value for 
impairment 
assessment 
involves 
significant 
management judgement/ estimates including the 
following key estimates:
i)	 Forecast of cash flows 
ii)	 Discount rates
iii)	Terminal growth rate 
iv)	Revenue market multiple
Considering the inherent complexities and 
significant judgements involved, the assessment 
of above impairment was considered as a key 
audit matter.
 
 
We evaluated the Company’s impairment model. 
This included assessing various assumptions 
used in the impairment model related to 
cash flows, discount rate, terminal value/ 
revenue market multiple, etc. used for material 
investments with assistance of valuation 
specialist wherever considered necessary.
 
 
We agreed relevant data with the latest 
budgets, actual past results and other 
supporting 
documents 
and 
checked 
the 
mathematical 
accuracy 
of 
the 
impairment model.
 
 
We assessed the Company’s sensitivity 
analysis 
and 
evaluated 
whether 
any 
reasonably 
foreseeable 
change 
in 
assumptions could lead to impairment or 
material change in the carrying value.
 
 
We assessed adequacy of relevant disclosures 
as per applicable accounting standards.
Other Information
The 
Company’s 
Board 
of 
Directors 
is 
responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included 
in the Annual report, but does not include 
the standalone financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial 
statements does not cover the other information 
and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the standalone 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read 
the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether such other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. 
The Annual report is not made available to us 
as at the date of this auditor’s report. We have 
nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management for 
the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the 
Act with respect to the preparation of these 
standalone financial statements that give a true 
and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance including other comprehensive

principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 
specified under section 133 of the Act read with

records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the 
Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation 
and presentation of the standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In 
preparing 
the 
standalone 
financial 
statements, management is responsible for 
assessing the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the 
Company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible 
for 
overseeing 
the 
Company’s 
financial 
reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the standalone 
financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs 
will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these standalone 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we 
exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional 
skepticism 
throughout 
the 
audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the standalone financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control. 
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the 
Company has adequate internal financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
financial 
statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness 
of 
accounting 
estimates 
and 
related 
disclosures made by management.

•	
Conclude 
on 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Company to 
cease to continue as a going concern. 
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the standalone financial 
statements, 
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and whether the standalone financial 
statements 
represent 
the 
underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation. 
We communicate with those charged with 
governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.

also 
provide 
those 
charged 
with 
governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the standalone financial statements for 
the financial year ended March 31, 2024 and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
The financial statements of the Company for 
the year ended March 31, 2023, included in 
these standalone financial statements, have 
been audited by the predecessor auditor who 
expressed an unmodified opinion on those 
statements on May 5, 2023.

(xviii) There has been no resignation of the 
statutory auditors during the year and 
accordingly requirement to report on 
Clause 3(xviii) of the Order is not applicable 
to the Company.
(xix)	
On the basis of the financial ratios 
disclosed in note 40(iv) to the financial 
statements, ageing and expected dates of 
realization of financial assets and payment 
of financial liabilities, other information 
accompanying the financial statements, 
our knowledge of the Board of Directors 
and management plans and based on our 
examination of the evidence supporting 
the assumptions, nothing has come to our 
attention, which causes us to believe that 
any material uncertainty exists as on the 
date of the audit report that Company is 
not capable of meeting its liabilities existing 
at the date of balance sheet as and when 
they fall due within a period of one year 
from the balance sheet date. We, however, 
state that this is not an assurance as to 
the future viability of the Company. We 
further state that our reporting is based 
on the facts up to the date of the audit 
report and we neither give any guarantee 
nor any assurance that all liabilities falling 
due within a period of one year from the 
balance sheet date, will get discharged by 
the Company as and when they fall due.
(xx)	The provisions of Section 135 to the 
Companies Act, 2013 in relation to Corporate 
Social Responsibility is not applicable to the 
Company. Accordingly, the requirement to 
report on clause 3(xx)(a) & 3(xx)(b) of the 
Order are not applicable to the Company.

Report on the Internal Financial 
Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls 
with 
reference 
to 
standalone 
financial 
statements of One 97 Communications Limited 
(“the Company”) as of March 31, 2024 in 
conjunction with our audit of the standalone 
financial statements of the Company for the 
year ended on that date.
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). 
These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to 
the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its 
assets, the prevention and detection of frauds 
and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on the Company's internal financial controls 
with reference to these standalone financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) 
and the Standards on Auditing, as specified 
under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to these standalone financial 
statements was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to 
obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of 
the internal financial controls with reference to 
these standalone financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to these standalone financial 
statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to 
these standalone financial statements.

Annexure 2 to the Independent Auditor’s report
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
With Reference to these Standalone 
Financial Statements
A company's internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements 
is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company's internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
generally 
accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Inherent 
Limitations 
of 
Internal 
Financial Controls With Reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error 
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial control with 
reference to standalone financial statements 
may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all 
material respects, adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements 
and 
such 
internal 
financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements were operating effectively as at 
March 31, 2024, based on the internal control 
over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

and merchants, wealth management etc. 
b) marketing services which primarily

ticketing business, providing voice and 
messaging 
platforms 
to

operators and enterprise customers and 
other businesses, etc.
	
These Standalone Financial Statements 
(“Financial Statements”) were authorised 
for issue in accordance with a resolution of 
the Board of Directors on May 22, 2024.
2.	 Material accounting policies
2.1	Basis of preparation
	
These Financial Statements of the Company 
have been prepared in accordance with 
Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) 
prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Act read with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and 
other relevant provisions of the Act as 
amended from time to time.
	
The 
financial 
statements 
have 
been 
prepared on a historical cost basis, except 
for certain financial assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value and amortised cost 
(refer accounting policies on financial 
instruments and Share-based payments).
	
Accounting policies have been consistently 
applied except where a newly issued 
accounting standard is initially adopted or a 
revision to an existing accounting standard 
requires a change in the accounting policy 
hitherto in use.
	
All the amounts included in the financial 
statements are presented in Indian Rupees 
(‘Rupees’ or ‘Rs.’ or ‘INR’) and are rounded to 
the nearest millions, except per share data 
and unless stated otherwise.
	
New and amended standards adopted by 
the Company
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has 
notified Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023 dated 
31 March 2023 to amend the following 
Ind AS which are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. 
The Company applied for the first-time 
these amendments. 
	
(i)	 Definition of Accounting Estimates - 
Amendments to Ind AS 8
	
	
The amendments clarify the distinction 
between 
changes 
in 
accounting 
estimates and changes in accounting 
policies and the correction of errors. 
It has also been clarified how entities 
use 
measurement 
techniques

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
and inputs to develop accounting 
estimates. The amendments had no 
impact on the Company’s standalone 
financial statements. 
	
(ii)	 Disclosure of Accounting Policies - 		
Amendments to Ind AS 1
	
	
The amendments aim to help entities 
provide accounting policy disclosures 
that are more useful by replacing the 
requirement for entities to disclose their 
‘significant’ accounting policies with a 
requirement to disclose their ‘material’ 
accounting policies and adding guidance 
on how entities apply the concept of 
materiality in making decisions about 
accounting policy disclosures. 
	
	
The amendments have had an impact 
on the Company’s disclosures of 
accounting 
policies, 
but 
not 
on 
the 
measurement, 
recognition 
or 
presentation of any items in the 
Company’s financial statements.
	
(iii)	Deferred Tax related to Assets and 
Liabilities 
arising 
from 
a 
Single 
Transaction - Amendments to Ind AS 12
	
	
The amendments narrow the scope of 
the initial recognition exception under 
Ind AS 12, so that it no longer applies 
to transactions that give rise to equal 
taxable 
and 
deductible 
temporary 
differences such as leases. There 
was no impact of the change on the 
financial statements.
	
	
Apart 
from 
these, 
consequential 
amendments and editorials have been 
made to other Ind AS like Ind AS 101, 
Ind AS 102, Ind AS 103, Ind AS 107, Ind 
AS 109, Ind AS 115 and Ind AS 34.
2.2 Summary of material accounting 
policies
a.	
Current versus non-current classification
	
	
The Company presents assets and 
liabilities in the balance sheet based on 
current / non-current classification. 
	
	
An asset is classified as current when it 
is expected to be realised or intended 
to be sold or consumed in normal 
operating cycle, held primarily for the 
purpose of trading, expected to be 
realised within twelve months after 
the reporting period, or cash or cash 
equivalent unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability 
for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period. All other assets are 
classified as non-current.
	
	
A liability is classified as current when 
it is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle, it is held primarily 
for the purpose of trading, it is due 
to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or there 
is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting 
period. The Company classifies all 
other liabilities as non-current.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities, 
are classified as non-current assets 
and liabilities.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
The operating cycle is the time 
between the acquisition of assets for 
processing and their realisation in cash 
and cash equivalents. The Company 
has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
	
b.	
Fair value measurement
	
	
The 
Company 
measures 
certain 
financial instruments (e.g. investments) 
at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
	
	
Fair value is the price that would 
be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. 
	
	
The fair value measurement is based on 
the presumption that the transaction to 
sell the asset or transfer the liabilities 
takes place either in the principal 
market for the asset or liability or in 
absence of principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the 
asset or liability.
	
	
A fair value measurement of a non-
financial asset takes into account a 
market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to 
another market participant that would 
use the asset in its highest and best use.
	
	
The 
Company 
uses 
valuation 
techniques that are appropriate in the 
circumstances and for which sufficient 
data are available to measure fair 
value, maximising the use of relevant 
observable inputs and minimising the 
use of unobservable inputs.
	
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair 
value is measured or disclosed in the 
financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
	
	
Level 1- Quoted (Unadjusted) marked 
prices in the active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities
	
	
Level 2- Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement is directly 
or indirectly observable
	
	
Level 3- Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant 
to 
the 
fair 
value 
measurement 
is unobservable.
	
	
For assets and liabilities that are 
recognised in the financial statements 
on a recurring basis, the Company 
determines 
whether 
transfers 
have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy 
by re-assessing categorisation (based on 
the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) 
at the end of each reporting period.
	
	
At 
each 
reporting 
date, 
the 
management analyses the movements 
in the values of assets and liabilities 
which are required to be re-measured 
or re-assessed as per the Company’s 
accounting policies. For this analysis, 
the management or its expert verifies 
the major inputs applied in the latest 
valuation by agreeing the information in 
the valuation computation to contracts 
and other relevant documents.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, 
the Company has determined classes 
of assets and liabilities on the basis of 
the nature, characteristics and risks of 
the asset or liability and the level of the 
fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
c.	
Revenue recognition
	
	
Revenue is measured based on the 
consideration specified in a contract 
with a customer (transaction price) net 
of variable consideration e.g. discounts, 
volume rebates, any payments made to 
a customer (unless the payment is for a 
distinct good or service received from 
the customer) and excludes amounts 
collected on behalf of third parties. The 
Company recognises revenue when 
it transfers control over a product or 
service to a customer. Revenue is only 
recognised to the extent that it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal 
will not occur. 
	
	
The Company provides incentives to 
its users in various forms including 
cashbacks. 
Incentives 
which 
are 
consideration payable to the customer 
that are not in exchange for a 
distinct good or service are generally 
recognized as a reduction of revenue.
	
	
Where the Company acts as an agent 
for selling goods or services, only 
the commission income is included 
within revenue. The specific revenue 
recognition criteria described below 
must also be met before revenue is 
recognized. Typically, the Company 
has a right to payment before or at 
the point that services are delivered. 
Cash received before the services are 
delivered is recognised as a contract 
liability. The amount of consideration 
does not contain a significant financing 
component as payment terms are 
less than one year.
	
	
Sale of services 
	
	
Revenue from services is recognized 
when 
the 
control 
in 
services 
is 
transferred as per the terms of the 
agreement with customer i.e. as and 
when services are rendered. Revenues 
are disclosed net of the Goods and 
Services Tax charged on such services. 
In terms of the contract, excess of 
revenue over the billed at the year-
end is carried in the balance sheet as 
trade receivables where the amount is 
recoverable from the customer without 
any 
future 
performance 
obligation 
and the Company has unconditional 
right over such consideration (i.e. if 
only the passage of time is required 
before payment of such consideration 
is due). Cash received before the 
services are delivered is recognised as 
a contract liability.
	
	
Commission
	
	
The Company facilitates recharge of 
talk time, bill payments and availability 
of bus tickets and earns commission for 
the respective services. Commission 
income 
is 
recognized 
when 
the 
control in services is transferred to the 
customer when the services have been 
provided by the Company.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
Service fees from merchants
	
	
The Company earns service fee from 
merchants and recognizes such revenue 
when the control in services have been 
transferred by the Company i.e. as and 
when services have been provided 
by the Company. Such service fee is 
generally determined as a percentage 
of transaction value executed by the 
merchants. Amount received by the 
Company 
pending 
settlement 
are 
disclosed as payable to the merchants 
under other financial liabilities.
	
	
Government Grants
	
	
The Company recognises government 
grants only when there is reasonable 
assurance 
that 
the 
conditions 
attached to them will be complied 
with, and the grants will be received. 
Government grants related to revenue 
are recognized on a systematic basis in 
the Standalone Statement of Profit and 
Loss as other operating revenue over 
the periods necessary to match them 
with the related costs, if any, which 
they are intended to compensate.
	
	
Interest income
	
	
For all debt instruments measured 
either at amortised cost or at fair 
value through other comprehensive 
income, interest income is recorded 
using the effective interest rate (EIR). 
EIR is the rate that exactly discounts 
the estimated future cash payments 
or receipts over the expected life of 
the financial instrument or a shorter 
period, where appropriate, to the gross 
carrying amount of the financial asset 
or to the amortised cost of a financial 
liability. When calculating the effective 
interest rate, the Company estimates 
the expected cash flows by considering 
all the contractual terms of the financial 
instrument but does not consider the 
expected credit losses. Interest income 
is included in other income in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
d.	
Trade receivable
	
	
Trade receivables are amounts due 
from customers for services performed 
in the ordinary course of business and 
reflects group’s unconditional right 
to consideration (that is, payment 
is due only on the passage of time). 
Trade 
receivables 
are 
recognised 
initially at the transaction price as they 
do not contain significant financing 
components. The Company holds the 
trade receivables with the objective 
of collecting the contractual cash 
flows and therefore measures them 
subsequently at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less 
loss allowance. 
	
e.	
Taxes
	
	
Current income tax
	
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities 
are measured at the amount expected to 
be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws 
used to compute the amount are those 
that are enacted or substantively enacted, 
at the reporting date in the countries where 
the Company operates and generates 
taxable income.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
Current income tax relating to items 
recognised outside statement of profit 
and loss is recognised either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity. 
Current tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction 
either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Management 
periodically 
evaluates 
positions taken in the tax returns 
with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject 
to interpretation and considers whether 
it is probable that a taxation authority 
will accept an uncertain tax treatment. 
The Company measures its tax balances 
either based on the most likely amount or 
the expected value, depending on which 
method provides a better prediction of 
the resolution of the uncertainty. 
 	
	
Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred 
tax 
is 
provided 
using 
the liability method on temporary 
differences between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred 
tax 
liabilities 
are 
recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences, except:
	
	
When the deferred tax liability arises 
from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit or loss.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for 
all deductible temporary differences, 
the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and any unused tax losses. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profit 
will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, and 
the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and unused tax losses can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each reporting 
date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred tax asset 
to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred 
tax assets are re-assessed at each 
reporting date and are recognised to 
the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable profits will allow the 
deferred tax asset to be recovered.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the year when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred 
tax 
relating 
to 
items 
recognised outside statement of profit 
and loss is recognised either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity. 
Deferred tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction 
either in OCI or directly in equity.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred 
tax liabilities are offset if a legally

enforceable right exists to set off 
current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and the deferred taxes relate 
to the same taxable entity and the 
same taxation authority.
	
	
Taxes paid on acquisition of assets or 
on incurring expenses
	
	
Assets are recognised net of the 
amount of GST paid, except when the 
tax incurred on a purchase of assets 
is not recoverable from the taxation 
authority, in which case, the tax paid 
is recognised as part of the cost of 
acquisition of the asset.
	
	
Expenses are recognised net of the 
amount of GST paid, except when the 
tax incurred on a purchase of services 
is not recoverable from the taxation 
authority, in which case, the tax 
paid is expensed off in statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
The net amount of tax recoverable from, 
or payable to, the taxation authority is 
included as part of other current/ non- 
current assets or other current liabilities 
in the balance sheet.
	
f.	
Property, plant and equipment
	
	
Property, plant and equipment are 
carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment, if any. Property, plant and 
equipment is depreciated on a written 
down value basis to its residual value 
over its estimated useful life. 
	
	
Costs directly attributable to acquisition 
are capitalized until the property, plant 
and equipment are ready for use, as 
intended by the management. 
	
	
Subsequent costs are capitalised on 
the carrying amount or recognised 
as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when future economic benefits 
associated with the item are probable 
to flow to the Company and cost of the 
item can be measured reliably. When 
significant parts of property, plant and 
equipment are required to be replaced 
at intervals, the Company depreciates 
them separately based on their specific 
useful lives. The carrying amount of 
any component accounted for as a 
separate asset is derecognised when 
replaced. All repair and maintenance 
are charged to statement of profit 
and loss during the reporting period in 
which they are incurred.
	
	
Advances paid towards the acquisition 
of property, plant and equipment 
outstanding at each balance sheet 
date is classified as capital advances 
under the non-current assets and the 
cost of assets not ready to use before 
such date are disclosed under ‘Capital 
work in progress’.
	
	
The gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is determined 
as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset and is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss on the date 
of disposal or retirement.
	
	
Depreciation is provided using the written 
down value method, except for plant and

machinery on which straight line method 
is used, based on technical evaluation 
done by the management and charged 
to statement of profit and loss, unless 
such expenditure forms part of carrying 
value of another asset, as per the useful

Companies Act, 2013, given below:

Leasehold 
improvements 
are 
depreciated over the shorter of their 
useful life or the lease term, unless the 
entity expects to use the assets beyond 
the lease term.
	
	
During the previous year, the Company 
had changed the method of depreciation 
for Plant & Machinery from written down 
value method to straight line method 
along with change in life to 3 years and 
2 years for EDC/POS machines and 
Sound box, respectively and the impact 
on account of such change in estimate 
was assessed to be immaterial for the 
current and future periods.
	
	
The residual values, useful lives and 
methods of depreciation of property, 
plant and equipment are reviewed at 
each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
	
g.	
Intangible assets
	
	
Separately acquired intangible assets, 
such as software are measured initially 
at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost 
less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Costs associated with maintaining 
software programmes are recognised 
as an expense as incurred. Development 
costs that are directly attributable to the 
design and testing of identifiable and 
unique software products controlled 
by the Company are recognised as 
intangible assets where the following 
criteria are met:
 
 
it is technically feasible to complete 
the software so that it will be 
available for use or sale
 
 
management intends to complete 
the software and use or sell it
 
 
there is an ability to use or 
sell the software
 
 
it can be demonstrated how the 
software will generate probable 
future economic benefits
 
 
adequate technical, financial and 
other resources to complete the 
development and to use or sell the 
software are available, and
 
 
the expenditure attributable to the 
software during its development 
can be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs that are 
capitalised as part of the software 
include employee costs.
	
	
Research and development costs
	
	
Research expenditure and development 
expenditure that do not meet the 
criteria above are recognised as an 
expense as incurred. Development 
costs previously recognised as an 
expense are not recognised as an asset 
in a subsequent period.
	
	
Amortization methods and periods
	
	
Amortization of intangible assets begins 
when development is complete and 
the asset is available for use. Software, 
licenses 
acquired 
and 
internally 
generated software are amortized at 
the rate of 40% per annum on written 
down value method. During the period 
of development, the asset is tested for 
impairment annually. The amortization 
period and the amortization method 
are reviewed at least at each financial 
year end. Changes in the expected 
useful life or the expected pattern 
of consumption of future economic 
benefits embodied in the asset are 
considered to modify the amortization 
period or method, as appropriate, and 
are treated as changes in accounting 
estimates. The amortization expense 
on intangible assets is recognized in 
the statement of profit and loss unless 
such expenditure forms part of carrying 
value of another asset.
	
	
Gains or losses arising from de-
recognition of an intangible asset are 
measured as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and are recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss when 
the asset is derecognized.
	
h.	
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
	
For 
all 
non-financial 
assets, 
the 
Company 
assesses 
whether 
there 
are indicators of impairment. If such 
an indicator exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss, if any. Where the asset 
does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the 
Company estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit 
(CGU) to which the asset belongs.
	
	
The recoverable amount for an asset or 
CGU is the higher of its value in use and 
fair value less costs of disposal. If the 
recoverable amount of an asset or CGU 
is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount, the asset or CGU is considered 
impaired and the carrying amount of 
the asset or CGU is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in the 
statement of profit and loss. 
	
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows of the asset or CGU are 
discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. 
In determining fair value less costs of 
disposal, recent market transactions are 
taken into account.

If no such transactions can be identified, 
an appropriate valuation model is used. 
These calculations are corroborated by 
valuation multiples, quoted share prices 
for publicly traded companies or other 
available fair value indicators.
	
	
The Company bases its impairment 
calculation on detailed budgets and 
forecast calculations. These budgets 
and forecast calculations generally 
cover a period of five years. For longer 
periods, a long-term growth rate is 
calculated and applied to project future 
cash flows after the fifth year. To 
estimate cash flow projections beyond 
periods covered by the most recent 
budgets/forecasts, 
the 
Company 
extrapolates cash flow projections in 
the budget using a steady or declining 
growth rate for subsequent years, 
unless an increasing rate can be 
justified. In any case, this growth rate 
does not exceed the long-term average 
growth rate for the products, industries, 
or country or countries in which the 
entity operates, or for the market in 
which the asset is used.
	
	
An assessment is made at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is an 
indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or 
have decreased. If such indication 
exists, the Company estimates the 
asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. 
A previously recognised impairment 
loss is reversed only if there has been 
a change in the assumptions used 
to determine the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount since the last 
impairment loss was recognised. The 
reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed 
its recoverable amount, nor exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had 
no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset in prior years. Such reversal 
is recognised in the statement of 
profit or loss.
	
i.	
Provisions and contingencies
	
	
Provisions
	
	
Provisions are recognised when the 
Company has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a 
past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. 
	
	
When the Company expects some 
or all of a provision to be reimbursed, 
the reimbursement is recognised as 
a separate asset, but only when the 
reimbursement 
is 
virtually 
certain. 
The expense relating to a provision is 
presented in the statement of profit 
and loss net of any reimbursement.
	
	
If the effect of the time value of money 
is material, provisions are discounted 
using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, 
when appropriate, the risks specific to 
the liability. When discounting is used, 
the increase in the provision due to 
the passage of time is recognised as 
a finance cost.

Contingencies
	
	
A contingent liability is a possible 
obligation that arises from past events 
whose existence will be confirmed by 
the occurrence or non-occurrence of 
one or more uncertain future events 
beyond the control of the Company 
or a present obligation that is not 
recognized because it is not probable 
that an outflow of resources will be 
required 
to 
settle 
the 
obligation. 
A contingent liability also arises in 
extremely rare cases where there is 
a liability that cannot be recognized 
because it cannot be measured reliably. 
The Company does not recognize a 
contingent liability but discloses its 
existence in the financial statements.
	
j.	
Retirement and other employee benefits
	
	
For defined benefit plans (gratuity), 
the liability or asset recognised in the 
balance sheet is the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation at the 
end of the reporting period less the 
fair value of plan assets. The defined 
benefit obligation is calculated by 
an independent actuary using the 
projected unit credit method. 
	
	
The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows by 
reference to market yields at the end 
of the reporting period on government 
bonds that have terms approximating 
to the terms of the related obligation.
	
	
The net interest cost is calculated 
by applying the discount rate to the 
net balance of the defined benefit 
obligation and the fair value of plan 
assets. This cost is included in employee 
benefit expense in the statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
Re-measurement gains and losses 
arising from experience adjustments and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are 
recognised in the period in which they 
occur, directly in other comprehensive 
income. They are included in retained 
earnings in the statement of changes 
in equity and in the balance sheet. Re-
measurements are not reclassified to 
profit or loss in the subsequent periods.
	
	
Changes in the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation resulting 
from plan amendments or curtailments 
are recognised immediately in profit or 
loss as past service cost.
	
	
The 
Company’s 
contributions 
to 
defined contribution plans (provident 
fund) are recognized in profit or loss 
when the employee renders related 
service. The Company has no further 
obligations under these plans beyond 
its periodic contributions.
	
	
The Company provides for liability at 
period end on account of un-availed 
earned leave and Long Term Incentive 
Plan (‘LTIP’) as per actuarial valuation 
using projected unit credit method.
	
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, 
including non-monetary benefits that 
are expected to be settled wholly 
within 12 months after the end of the 
period in which the employees render

the related service are recognised in 
respect of employees' services up to 
the end of the reporting period and are 
measured at the amounts expected 
to be paid when the liabilities are 
settled. The liabilities are presented as 
employee benefit payable under other 
financial liabilities in the balance sheet.
	
	
The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‘Code’) 
relating to employee benefits during 
employment 
and 
post-employment 
benefits received Presidential assent in 
September 2020. The Code has been 
published in the Gazette of India. Certain 
sections of the code came into effect on 
May 3, 2023. However, the final rules/
interpretation have not yet been issued. 
Based on a preliminary assessment, the 
entity believes the impact of the change 
will not be significant.
	
k.	
Share-based payments
	
	
Equity-settled transactions
	
	
Employees (including senior executives) 
of the Company receive remuneration 
in the form of share-based payments, 
whereby employees render services as 
consideration for equity instruments 
(equity-settled transactions).
	
	
The cost of equity-settled transactions 
is determined by the fair value at the 
date when the grant is made using an 
appropriate valuation model.
	
	
That cost is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in 
Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) 
reserves in equity, over the period in 
which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee 
benefits 
expense. 
The 
cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date 
until the vesting date reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Company’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The statement of profit 
and loss expense or credit for a period 
represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning 
and end of that period and is recognised 
in employee benefits expense.
	
	
Performance conditions which are 
market 
conditions 
are 
taken 
into 
account 
when 
determining 
the 
grant date fair value of the awards. 
Service and non-market performance 
conditions are not taken into account 
when determining the grant date fair 
value of awards, but the likelihood of 
the conditions being met is assessed 
as part of the Company’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest.
	
	
No expense is recognised for awards 
that do not ultimately vest because 
non-market 
performance 
and/or 
service conditions have not been met.
	
	
When the terms of an equity-settled 
award 
are 
modified, 
the 
minimum 
expense recognised is the expense 
had the terms not been modified, if the 
original terms of the award are met. An 
additional expense is recognised for 
any modification that increases the total 
fair value of the share-based payment 
transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to 
the employee as measured at the date of 
modification. Where an award is cancelled

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
by the entity or by the counterparty, any 
remaining element of the fair value of the 
award is expensed immediately through 
profit or loss.
	
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected as additional share 
dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
	
l.	
Financial instruments
	
	
A financial instrument is any contract 
that gives rise to a financial asset of 
one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.
	
	
Financial assets
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
All financial assets are recognised 
initially at fair value plus, in the case of 
financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs 
that are attributable to the acquisition 
of the financial asset. However, trade 
receivables that do not contain a 
significant financing component are 
measured at transaction price.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
For 
purposes 
of 
subsequent 
measurement, 
financial 
assets 
are 
classified in four categories:
 
 
Debt instruments at amortized cost
 
 
Debt instruments at fair value 
through 
other 
comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI)
 
 
Debt instruments, derivatives and 
equity instruments at fair value 
through profit or loss (FVTPL)
 
 
Equity instruments measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI)
	
	
Debt instruments at amortised cost
	
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the 
amortised cost if both the following 
conditions are met:
	
	
a)	 The asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold 
assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
	
	
b)	 Contractual terms of the asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial 
assets are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 
The EIR amortization is included in finance 
income in the profit or loss. The losses 
arising from impairment are recognised in 
the profit or loss. This category generally 
applies to trade and other receivables and 
is most relevant to the Company.
	
	
Debt instrument at FVTOCI
	
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at 
the FVTOCI if both of the following 
criteria are met:
	
	
a)	 The objective of the business model 
is achieved both by collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling 
the financial assets, and
Financial Statements
206
Annual Report 
2024

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
b)	 The asset’s contractual cash flows 
represent SPPI.
	
	
Debt instruments included within the 
FVTOCI category are measured initially 
as well as at each reporting date at 
fair value. Fair value movements are 
recognized in the other comprehensive 
income (OCI). However, the Company 
recognizes interest income, impairment 
losses 
and 
reversals 
and 
foreign 
exchange gain or loss in the statement of 
profit and loss. On derecognition of the 
asset, cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in OCI is reclassified from 
the equity to the statement of profit 
and loss. Interest earned whilst holding 
FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as 
interest income using the EIR method.
	
	
Debt instrument at FVTPL
	
	
FVTPL is a residual category for debt 
instruments. 
Any 
debt 
instrument, 
which does not meet the criteria for 
categorization as at amortized cost or 
as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
	
	
In addition, the Company may elect 
to designate a debt instrument, which 
otherwise meets amortized cost or 
FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, 
such election is allowed only if doing so 
reduces or eliminates a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency (referred to as 
‘accounting mismatch’). 
	
	
Debt instruments included within the 
FVTPL category are measured at fair 
value with all changes recognized in 
the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Equity investments
	
	
All equity investments in scope of 
Ind AS 109 are measured at fair 
value. The Company may make an 
irrevocable election to present in other 
comprehensive 
income 
subsequent 
changes in the fair value. The Company 
makes such election on an instrument-
by-instrument basis. The classification 
is made on initial recognition and 
is irrevocable.
	
	
If the Company decides to classify an 
equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all 
fair value changes on the instrument, 
excluding dividends, are recognized in 
the OCI. There is no recycling of the 
amounts from OCI to statement of profit 
or loss, even on sale of investment. 
However, the Company may transfer the 
cumulative gain or loss within equity.
	
	
Equity instruments included within the 
FVTPL category are measured at fair 
value with all changes recognized in 
the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
The equity securities which are not held 
for trading, and for which the Company 
has made an irrevocable election at initial 
recognition to recognize changes in fair 
value through OCI rather than profit or 
loss as these are strategic investments 
and the Company considered this to 
be more relevant.
	
	
Equity investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures are 
measured at cost. The investments 
are reviewed at each reporting date 
207
Annual Report

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment considering 
the provisions of Ind AS 36 ‘Impairment 
of Assets’. If any such indication exists, 
policy for impairment of non-financial 
assets is followed.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a 
part of a financial asset or part of a group 
of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised (i.e. removed from the 
Company’s balance sheet) when:
 
 
The rights to receive cash flows 
from the asset have expired, or
 
 
The Company has transferred its 
rights to receive cash flows from the 
asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party 
under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; 
and either (a) the Company has 
transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) the 
Company has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
	
	
When the Company has transferred 
its rights to receive cash flows from 
an asset or has entered into a pass-
through arrangement, it evaluates if 
and to what extent it has retained the 
risks and rewards of ownership. When 
it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of the asset, nor transferred control of 
the asset, the Company continues to 
recognise the transferred asset to the 
extent of the Company’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Company 
also recognises an associated liability. 
The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that the 
Company has retained.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the 
Company 
applies 
expected 
credit 
loss (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss 
on financial assets that are debt 
instruments, and are measured at 
amortised 
cost 
e.g., 
loans, 
debt 
securities, deposits, trade receivables 
and bank balance.
	
	
The 
Company 
follows 
‘simplified 
approach’ for recognition of impairment 
loss allowance on trade receivables. 
The application of simplified approach 
does not require the Company to 
track changes in credit risk. Rather, it 
recognises impairment loss allowance 
based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting 
date, right from its initial recognition. 
	
	
For recognition of impairment loss on 
other financial assets and risk exposure, 
the Company determines that whether 
there has been a significant increase in 
the credit risk since initial recognition. If 
credit risk has not increased significantly, 
12-month expected credit loss (ECL) 
is used to provide for impairment loss. 
However, if credit risk has increased 
significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a 
subsequent period, credit quality of the 
instrument improves such that there is 
no longer a significant increase in credit 
risk since initial recognition, then the 
Financial Statements
208
Annual Report 
2024

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
entity reverts to recognising impairment 
loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.
	
	
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit 
losses resulting from all possible 
default events over the expected life 
of a financial instrument. The 12-month 
ECL is a portion of the lifetime ECL 
which results from default events that 
are possible within 12 months after the 
reporting date. 
	
	
ECL is the difference between all 
contractual cash flows that are due 
to the Company in accordance with 
the contract and all the cash flows 
that the entity expects to receive 
(i.e., all cash shortfalls), discounted at 
the original EIR.
	
	
The Company uses a provision matrix 
to determine impairment loss allowance 
on portfolio of its trade receivables. 
The provision matrix is based on its 
historically observed default rates over 
the expected life of the trade receivables 
and is adjusted for forward-looking 
estimates. At every reporting date, the 
historical observed default rates are 
updated and changes in the forward-
looking estimates are analyzed.
	
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or 
reversal) recognized during the period 
is recognized as income/ expense in 
the statement of profit and loss. This 
amount is reflected under the head 
other expenses in the statement of 
profit and loss. For the financial assets 
measured as at amortised cost, ECL is 
presented as an allowance, i.e., as an 
integral part of the measurement of 
those assets in the balance sheet. The 
allowance reduces the net carrying 
amount. Until the asset meets write-off 
criteria, the Company does not reduce 
impairment allowance from the gross 
carrying amount.
	
	
Financial liabilities
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at 
initial recognition, as financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings, payables, or 
as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, 
as appropriate.
	
	
All financial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value and, in the 
case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs.
	
	
The 
Company’s 
financial 
liabilities 
include borrowings, lease liabilities, 
trade and other payables. 
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities 
depends on their classification as 
described below: 
	
	
Loans and borrowings
	
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using 
the EIR method. Gains and losses are 
recognised in profit or loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through the EIR amortisation process.
	
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that 
209

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included as finance 
costs in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised 
when the obligation under the liability 
is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is 
replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, 
or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an 
exchange or modification is treated as 
the derecognition of the original liability 
and the recognition of a new liability. 
The 
difference 
in 
the 
respective 
carrying amounts is recognised in the 
statement of profit or loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities 
are offset and the net amount is 
reported in the balance sheet if there 
is a currently enforceable legal right 
to offset the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net 
basis, to realise the assets and settle 
the liabilities simultaneously.
	
m.	 Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the 
standalone balance sheet comprise 
cash at banks and on hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less, which are 
subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
	
	
For the purpose of the standalone 
statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and short-
term deposits, as defined above, net 
of outstanding bank overdrafts as they 
are considered an integral part of the 
Company’s cash management.
	
n.	
Leases
	
	
The Company as a lessee
	
	
The Company’s lease asset classes 
primarily consist of leases for land and 
office premises. The Company assesses 
whether a contract contains a lease, 
at inception of a contract. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration. To assess 
whether a contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset, 
the Company assesses whether: (i) the 
contact involves the use of an identified 
asset (ii) the Company has substantially 
all of the economic benefits from use 
of the asset through the period of the 
lease and (iii) the Company has the 
right to direct the use of the asset.
	
	
At the date of commencement of 
the lease, the Company recognizes 
a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, 
except for leases with a term of twelve 
months or less (short-term leases) and 
low value leases. For these short-term 
and low value leases, the Company 
recognizes the lease payments as an 
operating expense on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
	
	
Certain lease arrangements includes 
the options to extend or terminate the 
lease before the end of the lease term.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably 
certain that they will be exercised.
	
	
The right-of-use assets are initially 
recognized at cost, which comprises 
the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made 
at or prior to the commencement 
date of the lease plus any initial direct 
costs less any lease incentives. They 
are subsequently measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any.
	
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated 
from the commencement date on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of 
the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. Right of use assets are 
evaluated for recoverability whenever 
events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, the recoverable 
amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value 
less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is 
determined on an individual asset basis 
unless the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are largely independent of 
those from other assets. In such cases, 
the recoverable amount is determined 
for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to 
which the asset belongs.
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured 
at amortized cost at the present 
value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted 
using the interest rate implicit in the 
lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates 
in the country of domicile of these 
leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured 
with a corresponding adjustment to 
the related right of use asset if the 
Company changes its assessment if 
whether it will exercise an extension or 
a termination option.
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been 
separately presented in the standalone 
balance sheet and lease payments have 
been classified as financing cash flows.
	
o.	
Earnings/ (loss) per share (EPS)
	
	
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by 
dividing the profit/ (loss) for the year 
attributable to equity holders by the 
weighted average number of Equity

q.	
Use of estimates 
	
	
The Company is required to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect 
the 
reported 
amounts 
of 
assets, 
liabilities, 
disclosure 
of 
contingent 
liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts 
of 
revenue 
and 
expenses 
during 
the reporting period. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates. 
The Company bases its estimates on 
historical experience and on various 
other assumptions that are believed to 
be reasonable, the results of which form 
the basis for making judgements about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities.
	
r.	
Exceptional Items
	
	
On certain occasions, the size, type 
or incidence of an item of income or 
expense, pertaining to the ordinary 
activities of the Company is such that its 
disclosure improves the understanding 
of the performance of the Company. 
Such income or expense is classified 
as an exceptional item and accordingly 
disclosed in the financial statements. 
Significant impact on the financial 
statements arising from impairment and 
non-recurring events are considered 
and reported as exceptional items.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Company 
becomes obliged to exercise (or not exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty 
is only revised if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs, which 
affects this assessment, and that is within the control of the lessee. The Company has given 
notice to vacate certain office premises. This has been accounted as lease termination. Hence, 
in accordance with Ind AS 116, Lease Liability has been re-measured by INR 204 ( March 31, 
2023: 9) with corresponding adjustment to Right of Use assets amounting to INR 185 (March 
31, 2023: 8) and the remaining balance has been included in Miscellaneous Income disclosed 
under Other Income in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
The total cash outflow for leases for the year ended is INR 440 (March 31, 2023: 554)
	
Extension and termination options:
	
Extension and termination options are included in certain leases. These are used to maximise 
operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Company’s operations. In 
certain cases, the extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Company 
and not by the respective lessor.

on May 24, 2023, the Company has filed a claim with the IRP for recovery of outstanding 
balances. Pending outcome of the insolvency proceedings, the management has provided for 
the balance INR 57 as exceptional item in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss.
b)	 During the Current year ended March 31, 2024, the Company has recognized provision for 
impairment in the carrying value of its investment in its associate, Infinity Transoft Solutions 
Private Limited of INR 20 and during the previous year March 31, 2023, in carrying value of 
its investments in its subsidiaries, Orbgen Technologies Private Limited, Paytm Insurance 
Broking Private Limited and Little Internet Private Limited of INR 104, INR 525 and INR 
1 respectively. The provision for impairment has been shown as an exceptional item in 
the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. During the current and previous years, the 
impairment losses for these investments was based on the equity value calculated based on 
cash flow projections with the business plan used for impairment testing using discounted 
cash flow method. The management has computed equity value based on discount rate 
of 20.8% (March 31, 2023: 22.5%) and terminal growth rate used in extrapolating cash 
flows beyond the planning period of 2.45 (March 31, 2023: 2.45) times of revenue of the 
terminal year.	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
22. Earnings per shares (EPS)
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/ (loss) for the year attributable to equity 
holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/ (loss) for the year attributable to equity 
holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the 
year plus the weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued on conversion of all 
the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
23. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Company’s Standalone Financial Statements requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, 
assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.	
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next 12 months, are described below.
Deferred taxes
Deferred tax assets can be recognised for deductible temporary differences (including unused 
tax losses) only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. As the Company is yet to generate operating 
profits, Management has assessed that as at March 31, 2024 it is not probable that such deferred 
tax assets can be realised in excess of available taxable temporary differences. Management re-
assesses unrecognised deferred tax assets at each reporting date and recognises to the extent 
that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be 
recovered. For details about deferred tax assets, refer note 27.
During FY 2019-20 (AY 2020-21) a shareholder of the Company holding 30.33% of shares of 
the Company had transferred its shareholding to its group company (both entities being 100% 
subsidiaries of the same ultimate parent entity). Based on advice from the Company's tax experts, 
Management has assessed that a mere change in shareholding within the same group will not be 
an affirmative position to say that the shareholding has been changed. Further, since the shares 
of the Company carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power were beneficially held 
by persons, i.e. ultimate holding company of the aforesaid entities, who beneficially held shares 
of the company carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power on the last day of the 
year or years in which the loss was incurred, the Company shall be entitled to carry forward and 
set off these losses against the taxable income of future years in accordance with the provisions 
of Section 79 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. (Refer note 27)
Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits) 
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are 
determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions 
that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the 
discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the 
valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in 
these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
23. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
(Contd..)
In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated in India, the management 
considers the interest rates of government bonds in India. The mortality rate is based on publicly 
available mortality tables for India. The mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response 
to demographic changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected 
future inflation rates. For further details about gratuity obligations, refer note 26.
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the standalone balance 
sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured 
using valuation techniques including the DCF model, Price of Recent Investment (PORI) method 
and Comparable Company Multiples (CCM) method. The inputs to these models are taken from 
observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is 
required in establishing fair values. For further details about Fair value measurement, refer note 30.
Impairment of financial assets
The Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit risk associated with its 
assets carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there 
has been a significant increase in credit risk. Note 31 details how the Company determines whether 
there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
Impairment reviews
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are tested for impairment at-least on an annual basis 
or when events that occur / changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount is less 
than its carrying value. In calculating the value in use, the Company is required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions inter-alia concerning the growth in EBITDA, long-term growth rates; 
discount rates to reflect the risks involved. The carrying value is less than the net worth of certain 
subsidiaries. The Company basis the underlying business and future business projections, does not 
consider there to be any diminution in the value of such investments. For details about impairment 
reviews, refer note 21.	
The Company has investment in PPBL, an associate. During the year, given certain developments, 
the Company has recorded impairment of 100% carrying value. A qualitative assessment requires 
significant judgement (refer note 41)
Incentives
The Company provides incentives to users in various forms including cash backs to promote our 
platform. Incentives to users to whom the Company has a performance obligation is recorded as a 
reduction of revenue to the extent of the revenue earned. For the incentives to other transacting 
Financial Statements

2024

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
users to whom the Company has no performance obligation, management is required to determine 
whether the incentives are in substance a payment on behalf of the merchants and should 
therefore be recorded as a reduction of revenue or as marketing and promotional expenses. Some 
of the factors considered in management’s evaluation of such incentives being payments on behalf 
of  merchants include whether the incentives are given at the Company’s discretion, contractual 
agreements with the merchants, business strategy and objectives and design of the incentive 
program(s), etc. 
Share-based payments 
Employees of the Company receive remuneration in the form of share based payment instruments, 
whereby employees render services to group and receive equity instrument of Holding Company 
as consideration (equity-settled transactions). In accordance with the Ind AS 102 Share Based 
Payments, the cost of equity-settled transactions is measured using the fair value method. The 
cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the company's best 
estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.

26. Gratuity
The Company provides for gratuity for employees in India as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. 
Employees who are in continuous service for a period of 5 years are eligible for gratuity. The amount 
of gratuity payable on retirement/termination is the employees last drawn basic salary per month 
computed proportionately for 15 days salary multiplied for the number of years of service upto a 
limit of INR 20 Lakhs. The gratuity plan is a funded plan and the Company makes contributions to 
recognised fund/insurer in India. The Company does not fully fund the liability and maintains a target 
level of funding to be maintained over a period of time based on estimations of expected gratuity 
payments. Disclosures given below are as per actuarial valuation report of independent Actuary.
The following tables summarize the components of net benefit expenses recognized in the 
Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss and the funded status and amount recognized in the

The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates 
the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions 
occurring at the end of the reporting period. The methods and types of assumptions used in 
preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior year.	
	
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the period ending March 31, 
2025 are INR 1064 (March 31, 2024 - INR 254).
	
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 4 years (March 31, 2023- 
2.79 years). 	
	 	
	
	
	
The average remaining working life of members of the defined benefit obligation as at March 
31, 2024 is 30.67 years (as at March 31, 2023- 30.87 years)

Risk exposure
	
Through its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most 
significant of which are detailed below:
	
Asset volatility: The plan assets are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to 
bond yields. If plan assets underperform this yield, there will be a deficit of the plan asset 
investments in fixed income securities with high grades and in government securities. These 
are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk to an acceptable level.
	
Changes in bond yields: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based 
on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
	
Inflation risks: The payments are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
	
Life expectancy: Obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in 
life expectancy and inflation will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. This is particularly 
significant where inflationary conditions result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.
	
Major categories of plans assets are as follows:

ii)	 The Company will continue to assess the impact of further developments relating to 
retrospective application of Supreme Court judgement dated February 28, 2019 clarifying 
the definition of 'basic wages' under Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous 
Provisions Act 1952 and deal with it accordingly. In the assessment of the management, 
the aforesaid matter is not likely to have a significant impact and accordingly, no provision 
has been made in these Standalone Financial Statements.
	
	
Notes:
	
	
1)	 It is not practicable for the Company to estimate the timing of cash outflows, if any.

The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk 
and liquidity risk. The Company continues to focus on a system-based approach to business 
risk management. The Company’s financial risk management process seeks to enable the early 
identification, evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business. Backed by strong 
internal control systems, the current Risk Management Framework rests on policies and procedures 
issued by appropriate authorities; process of regular internal reviews/audits to set appropriate risk 
limits and controls; monitoring of such risks and compliance confirmation for the same.

a.	 Market Risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market prices. Market prices comprise three types of risk: interest rate 
risk, foreign currency risk and price risk. The Company has in place appropriate risk management 
policies to limit the impact of these risks on its financial performance. The Company ensures 
optimization of cash through fund planning and robust cash management practices.
	
(i)	 Interest Rate Risk
	
	
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial 
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. There is no interest 
rate risk as the Company did not have borrowings at the end of the current and previous year.
	
(ii)	 Price risk
	
	
The Company invests its surplus funds in fixed deposits, Commercial papers, Treasury bills, 
Government Securities, Certificate of deposits and non-convertible debentures. There is 
no exposure of price risk on such instruments.
	
	
The Company is also exposed to equity/ preference shares price risk arising from investments 
held by the Company and classified in the balance sheet either as fair value through OCI 
or at fair value through profit or loss (refer note 7(a) and 7(b)). To manage its price risk 
arising from investments in equity/ preference shares, the company diversifies its portfolio. 
Diversification of the portfolio is done in accordance with the limits set by the company.
	
(iii)	Foreign currency risk
	
	
The Indian Rupee is the Company’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the 
Company’s results are presented in Indian Rupee and exposures are managed against 
Indian Rupee accordingly. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash 
flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The 
Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to 
the Company’s operating activities and investing activities (when revenue, expense and 
Property, Plant and Equipment is denominated in a foreign currency).

The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity of profit or loss to a reasonably possible 
change in USD exchange rates, with all other variables held constant.

The Company’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material. 
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a reasonably possible change in the under-
lying foreign currency against the functional currency while assuming all other variables 
to be constant.
	
	
Based on the movements in the foreign exchange rates historically and the prevailing 
market conditions as at the reporting date, the Company’s management has concluded 
that the above mentioned rates used for sensitivity are reasonable benchmarks.
b.	 Credit Risk
	
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument 
or contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating 
activities (primarily trade receivables) including deposits with banks. Management has a credit 
policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. The Company 
applies expected credit loss (ECL) model on financial assets measured at amortised cost e.g., 
loans, debt securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank balance. Cash and cash equivalents 
are also subject to the impairment requirement of Ind AS 109, the identified impairment loss 
was immaterial.
	
All of the entity's investments and loans at amortised cost are considered to have low credit 
risk, and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 months 
expected losses. Management considers instruments to be low credit risk when they have 
a low risk of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow 
obligations in the near term.

(i)	 Trade receivables
	
	
The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers. Customer 
credit risk is managed subject to the Company’s established policy, procedures and control 
relating to customer credit risk management. An impairment analysis is performed at each 
reporting date by grouping the receivables in homogeneous group. The calculation is based 
on lifetime expected credit losses.

(ii)	 Other investments (excluding loans to related parties)
	
	
All of the entity’s other investments (preference shares, government securities, commercial 
papers, treasury bills and security deposits) at amortised cost are considered to have low 
credit risk, and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 
months’ expected losses. Management consider ‘low credit risk’ for listed instruments to be 
an investment grade credit rating with at least one major rating agency. Other instruments 
are considered to have low credit risk when they have a low risk of default and the issuer 
has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.
	
(iii)	Loan to related parties
	
	
The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of loan and 
whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout 
each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the 
Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the loan as at the reporting date with 
the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and 
supportive forwarding-looking information.
	
(iv)	Other financial assets
	
	
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Company’s 
treasury department in accordance with the Company’s policy. Investment of surplus funds 
is made only with banks of high repute.
	
	
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet at 
March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is the carrying amounts as disclosed in Note 7 (c) and 7 (d).

41. On January 31, 2024, the RBI issued a Press Release for action against Paytm Payments Bank 
Ltd (PPBL), a 39% associate of the Company, under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 
1949, effectively restricting PPBL’s normal business, permitting only withdrawal of the existing 
customer balances. 
Pursuant to the RBI’s actions as stated above, the Company has terminated its Nodal Accounts 
being maintained with PPBL. Subsequently, the Company has discontinued all major business 
activities it had with PPBL. Further, the Company has also made amendment to the shareholders 
agreement with PPBL by simplifying the terms therein and has also withdrawn its nominee director 
from the board of PPBL.
The business of PPBL has been significantly impacted by the RBI action as described above. As at 
March 31, 2024, the Company has investments in PPBL amounting to INR 2,096 million.
The Company understand that there are certain factors affecting ongoing operations of PPBL, 
including restrictions which affect normal operations of the primary products such as wallet and 
banking services etc. as per regulatory action on Jan 31, 2024, as well as ongoing uncertainty on 
the timing and nature of restoration of any of the impacted services.
Considering the future uncertainties associated on the business operations of PPBL as mentioned 
above, including the uncertainty of any other regulatory development, the scaled down business 
operations of PPBL, restrictions affecting normal operations of the primary products such as saving 
accounts, current accounts, wallet, the management, on a prudent basis, has determined that 
the value of the Company’s investment in PPBL is impaired and, accordingly, has recorded an 
impairment provision of INR 2,096 million, representing the carrying value of its investment in PPBL 
and disclosed the same as impairment of investment in associate.
42. The Company during the year ended March 31, 2022 granted 21,000,000 Employee Stock 
Options to Managing Director and CEO of the Company which is subject to achievement of specified 
milestones. During the current year, the Company has received a Show Cause Notice (“SCN”) from 
SEBI related to the above options regarding compliance with SEBI SBEB Regulations. The Company 
has submitted its preliminary response and is in the process of seeking further information from 
SEBI in this regard. Based on an independent legal opinion obtained by the management, it believes 
that the Company is compliant with the relevant regulations. Accordingly, there is no impact on the 
financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.
(xiii) Registration of charges or satisfaction with Registrar of Companies
	
There are no charges or satisfaction which are yet to be registered with the Registrar of 
Companies beyond the statutory period.
(xiv) Utilisation of borrowings availed from banks and financial institutions.
	
The Company has not availed any borrowings from banks and financial institutions during the 
current year and previous year.

43.  The Company has used accounting software for maintaining its books of account which has a 
feature of recording audit trail (edit log) facility and the same has operated throughout the year for 
all relevant transactions recorded in the software except that, audit trail feature is not enabled and 
thus not operated for certain changes made using privileged access rights. The audit trail feature 
has not been tampered with in respect of such accounting software.
The feature of recording audit trail (edit log) facility was not enabled for certain subs-systems 
and certain applications, operated by third party software service provider, used for processing 
underlying transactions. Due to the same, management is unable to verify if there have been any 
instances of the audit trail feature being tampered with.
The management is in process of evaluating appropriate measures to enable audit trail 
in these systems.
44. During the previous year ended March 31, 2022, the Company had transferred online 
Payment Aggregator business to Paytm Payments Services Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of the Company for a consideration of INR 2,838 for transfer of business based on the carrying 
value of the net assets of the business as on September 1, 2021 to be settled in five equal annual 
installments payable at the end of each year without any interest. The difference between present 
value of consideration and net assets amounting to INR 601 has been accounted as 'Deemed 
Investment'. As at year end the balance amounts to INR 1,521 (INR 516 being current and INR 1,005 
classified as non-current).
45. For impairment testing, the management has treated investment in PPBL as a separate CGU 
and there is no change is the composition of this CGU since previous estimate of its recoverable 
amount. The impairment loss pertains to single segment as identified in note 33.
Considering the factors stated in note 41, the Company has determined, on a prudent basis, that 
both the value-in-use and fair value less cost of disposal of the Company’s investment in PPBL are 
nil at the reporting date. Since the management has used qualitative factors to determine value-
in-use as well as fair value less cost of disposal of the Company’s investment in PPBL, separate 
disclosures such as fair value hierarchy, valuation technique and assumptions used including 
discount rate are not separately given.
46. Previous year figures have been audited by a firm of Chartered Accountants other than S.R.

information required by the Companies Act, 2013, 
as amended (“the Act”) in the manner so required 
and give a true and fair view in conformity with 
the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the 
Group, its associates and  joint ventures as at 
March 31, 2024, their consolidated loss including 
other comprehensive income, their consolidated 
cash flows and the consolidated statement of 
changes in equity for the year ended on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under 
section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities 
under those Standards are further described 
in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements’ 
section of our report. We are independent 
of the Group, associates, joint ventures in 
accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India together with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements under the provisions of the Act and 
the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements and the Code of Ethics. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements.
Emphasis of Matter
We draw attention to Note 42 to the Financial 
Statements which describes that the subsidiary 
company's application for authorization to set 
up Payment System, to the Department of 
Payment and Settlement Systems, Reserve 
Bank of India (“RBI”), is in process due to the 
reasons stated in the said note. Accordingly, no 
adjustment has been made by the management 
in these Financial Statements. Our opinion is 
not modified in respect of this matter
Key Audit Matters

March 31, 2024. These matters were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a

misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements. The results of audit procedures 
performed by us and by other auditors of 
components not audited by us, as reported by 
them in their audit reports furnished to us by 
the management, including those procedures 
performed to address the matters below, 
provide the basis for our audit opinion on the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Assessment of carrying value of investment in Paytm Payments Bank Limited (“PPBL”) (Refer 
accompanying notes 5 (b) and 45 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
The Company is a 49% shareholder in Paytm 
Payments Bank Limited (“PPBL”), which is treated as 
an associate entity of the Company.
The Group’s investments in  its  associate are 
accounted for using the equity method as required 
under the Ind AS 28. Under the equity method, the 
investment in an associate is initially recognised 
at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is 
adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of 
net assets of the associate since the acquisition date.
On January 31, 2024, the RBI issued a Press Release, 
imposing significant restrictions on the business 
operation of PPBL and permitted only withdrawal/ 
utilisation of the available balances by customers 
from their accounts.
Considering the uncertainties pertaining to the above 
RBI notice on the underlying recoverable value of 
its investments, the management performed an 
impairment assessment on the carrying value of 
investment in PPBL. Such assessment was primarily 
on the basis of qualitative factors in light of the RBI 
press release, such as, the scaled down business 
operationsof PPBL and its business prospects 
including restrictions affecting normal operations of 
the primary products such as wallet, likelihood of any 
regulatory developments, as well as non-availability 
of 
audited 
financial 
information 
from 
PPBL. 
Our procedures included the following:
 
 
We have read the Press Release and related 
FAQs issued by RBI in relation to imposition 
of 
significant 
restrictions 
on 
business 
operation of PPBL. 
 
 
We 
discussed 
with 
the 
Company’s 
management to obtain their understanding of 
the potential implication of the restrictions on 
the operation of PPBL, tested the arithmetical 
accuracy of the equity accounting up to March 
31, 2024 and impairment loss recognized by 
the Company in respect of PPBL.
 
 
We obtained and read the management 
assessment pertaining to impairment of its 
investment in PPBL.
 
 
We 
assessed 
adequacy 
of 
relevant 
disclosures in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements on the basis of unaudited financial 
information of PPBL.

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Based on the foregoing, the Group recorded an 
impairment loss of Rs 2,271 million, representing the 
entire residual carrying amount of the Company’s 
investment in PPBL.
Considering the inherent complexities and significant 
judgements involved, the assessment of above 
impairment was considered as a key audit matter. 
Assessment of impairment of goodwill relating to acquisition of subsidiaries and assessment of 
appropriateness of the carrying value of investments in other associates (Refer accompanying notes 4 & 5 
(b) to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
The Group performed an impairment assessment 
over the goodwill balance by calculating the 
recoverable value of the cash generating unit (CGU) 
to which the Goodwill belongs using   a discounted 
cash flow model and comparing the same with the 
carrying value of goodwill as per Ind AS 36. For the 
purpose of impairment assessment, each subsidiary 
is considered as separate CGU.
Further, there are certain investments in associates 
which are carried at cost (subject to impairment 
assessment).
The 
determination 
of 
recoverable 
value 
for 
impairment 
assessment 
involves 
significant 
management judgement/ estimates including the 
following key estimates:
i)	 Forecast of cash flows 
ii)	 Discount rates
iii)	Terminal growth rate 
iv)	Revenue market multiple
Considering the inherent complexities and significant 
judgements involved, the assessment of above 
(including investments in associates) impairment 
was considered as a key audit matter.
Our procedures included the following:
 
 
We evaluated the Company’s assessment for 
identification of indicators of impairment.
 
 
We obtained an understanding from the 
management, assessed and tested the design 
and operating effectiveness of the Company’s 
key controls over the impairment assessment 
including determination of recoverable value .
 
 
We evaluated the Company’s impairment model. 
This included assessing various assumptions 
used in the impairment model related to 
cash flows, discount rate, terminal value/ 
revenue market multiple, etc. used for material 
investments with assistance of valuation 
specialist wherever considered necessary.
 
 
We agreed relevant data with the latest budgets, 
actual past results and other supporting 
documents and checked the mathematical 
accuracy of the impairment model.
 
 
We 
assessed 
the 
Company’s 
sensitivity 
analysis and evaluated whether any reasonably 
foreseeable change in assumptions could 
lead to impairment or material change in the 
carrying value.
 
 
We assessed adequacy of relevant disclosures 
as per applicable accounting standards

Independent Auditor’s Report
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs 
will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we 
exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional 
skepticism 
throughout 
the 
audit. We also:
a)	 Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design 
and 
perform 
audit 
procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control. 
b)	 Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the 
Holding Company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial 
statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
c)	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness 
of 
accounting 
estimates 
and 
related 
disclosures made by management. 
d)	 Conclude 
on 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on 
the ability of the Group and its associates and 
joint ventures to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in 
our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group and its 
associates and joint ventures to cease to 
continue as a going concern. 
e)	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the consolidated financial 
statements, 
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and whether the consolidated financial 
statements 
represent 
the 
underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation. 
f)	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the

Independent Auditor’s Report
entities or business activities within the 
Group and its associates and joint ventures 
of which we are the independent auditors, 
to express an opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements. We are responsible for 
the direction, supervision and performance 
of the audit of the financial statements of 
such entities included in the consolidated 
financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors. For the other entities 
included in the consolidated financial 
statements, which have been audited by 
other auditors, such other auditors remain 
responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the audits carried out 
by them. We remain solely responsible for 
our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with 
governance of the Holding Company and such 
other entities included in the consolidated 
financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other 
matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We 
also 
provide 
those 
charged 
with 
governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements 
for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
a)	 We did not audit the financial statements 
and other financial information, in respect of 
6 subsidiaries, whose financial statements 
include total assets of Rs 19,014 million 
as at March 31, 2024, and total revenues

Rs 78 million for the year ended on that 
date. These financial statement and other 
financial information have been audited by 
other auditors, which financial statements, 
other financial information and auditor’s 
reports have been furnished to us by the 
management. The consolidated financial 
statements also include the Group’s share 
of net loss of Rs. 12 million for the year 
ended March 31, 2024, as considered in 
the consolidated financial statements, in 
respect of four associates and one joint 
ventures, whose financial statements, other 
financial information have been audited 
by other auditors and whose reports have 
been furnished to us by the Management. 
Our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, in so far as it relates to the 
amounts 
and 
disclosures 
included 
in 
respect of these subsidiaries, joint ventures 
and associates, and our report in terms 
of sub-sections (3) of Section 143 of the

and total revenues of Rs 433 million 
and net cash inflows of Rs 134 million 
for the year ended on that date. These

consolidated financial statements also 
include the Group’s share of net loss of Rs. 
303 million for the year ended March 31, 
2024, [including Rs 276 million in respect 
of PPBL – refer note 24] as considered in

respect of six  associates and one joint

whose 
financial 
statements, 
other financial information have not been

statements, 
other 
unaudited 
financial

respect of these subsidiaries, joint ventures 
and associates, and our report in terms 
of sub-sections (3) of Section 143 of the 
Act in so far as it relates to the aforesaid 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, 
is based solely on such unaudited financial 
statements and other unaudited financial

to us by the Management, these financial 
statements and other financial information 
are not material to the Group.
Our opinion above on the consolidated financial 
statements, and our report on Other Legal and

Report on the Internal Financial 
Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of One 97 Communications 
Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding 
Company”) as of and for the year ended March 
31, 2024, we have audited the internal financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
consolidated 
financial statements of the Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries together referred to as 
“the Group”), its associates and joint ventures, 
which are companies incorporated in India, 
as of that date. 
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal Financial Controls 
The respective Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group, its associates 
and joint ventures, which are companies 
incorporated in India, are responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the 
Holding Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the 
design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to the respective company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the 
Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on the Holding Company's internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) 
and the Standards on Auditing, specified 
under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls, both, issued by ICAI. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls 
with 
reference 
to 
consolidated 
financial 
statements was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to 
obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of 
the internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control

Annexure 2 to the Independent Auditor’s report
based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained and the audit evidence obtained by 
the other auditors in terms of their reports 
referred to in the Other Matters paragraph 
below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
With 
Reference 
to 
Consolidated 
Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with 
reference to consolidated financial statements 
is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company's internal financial control with 
reference to consolidated financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
generally 
accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Inherent 
Limitations 
of 
Internal 
Financial Controls With Reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements, including the possibility of 
collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error 
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

are companies incorporated in India, is based 
on the corresponding reports of the auditors of

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
1.	 Corporate information
	
These Consolidated Financial Statements 
(“Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements”) 
comprise the financial statements of One 
97 Communications Limited (“hereinafter 
referred to as the Holding Company”) and 
its subsidiaries, (the Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries together referred to 
as “the Group”), its joint ventures and 
associate companies for the year ended 
March 31, 2024.
	
One 97 Communications Limited is a 
public company domiciled in India and 
is incorporated under the provisions of 
the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”). The 
registered office of the Holding Company 
is located at 1st Floor, Devika Tower, Nehru 
Place, New Delhi - 110019. The principal 
place of business of the Group is in India. 
The equity shares of the Holding Company 
are listed on the National Stock Exchange 
of India Limited (“NSE”) and the BSE Limited 
(“BSE”) in India.
	
The Group is in the business of providing 
a)	 payment and financial services which 
primarily includes payment facilitator services, 
facilitation of consumer and merchant loan 
distribution to consumers and merchants, 
wealth management etc. b) marketing services 
which primarily consists of aggregator for 
digital products, ticketing business, providing 
voice and messaging platforms to the telecom 
operators and enterprise customers and other 
businesses, etc.
	
These Consolidated Financial Statements 
were authorised for issue in accordance 
with a resolution of the Board of Directors 
on May 22, 2024.
2.	 Material accounting policies
2.1	Basis of preparation
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements 
of the Group have been prepared in 
accordance 
with 
Indian 
Accounting 
Standards (‘Ind AS’) prescribed under 
Section 133 of the Act read with the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 and other relevant provisions of 
the Act as amended from time to time.
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements 
have been prepared on a historical cost 
basis, except for certain financial assets 
and liabilities measured at fair value and 
amortised cost (refer accounting policies 
on 
financial 
instruments 
and 
Share-
based payments).
	
Accounting policies have been consistently 
applied except where a newly issued 
accounting standard is initially adopted or a 
revision to an existing accounting standard 
requires a change in the accounting policy 
hitherto in use.
	
All the amounts included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements are presented in 
Indian Rupees (‘Rupees’ or ‘Rs.’ or ‘INR’) and 
are rounded to the nearest millions, except 
per share data and unless stated otherwise.
	
New and amended standards adopted by the 
Group 
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Amendment Rules, 2023 dated 31 March 
2023 to amend the following Ind AS which 
are effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 April 2023. The Group applied 
for the first-time these amendments. 
Annual Report  
2024

Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 341
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
(i)	 Definition of Accounting Estimates - 
Amendments to Ind AS 8
	
	
The amendments clarify the distinction 
between 
changes 
in 
accounting 
estimates and changes in accounting 
policies and the correction of errors. 
It has also been clarified how entities 
use 
measurement 
techniques 
and inputs to develop accounting 
estimates. The amendments had no 
impact on the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements. 
	
(ii)	 Disclosure of Accounting Policies - 
Amendments to Ind AS 1
	
	
The amendments aim to help entities 
provide accounting policy disclosures 
that are more useful by replacing the 
requirement for entities to disclose 
their ‘significant’ accounting policies 
with a requirement to disclose their 
‘material’ 
accounting 
policies 
and 
adding guidance on how entities 
apply the concept of materiality in 
making decisions about accounting 
policy disclosures. 
	
	
The amendments have had an impact on 
the Group’s disclosures of accounting 
policies, but not on the measurement, 
recognition or presentation of any 
items in the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.
	
(iii)	Deferred Tax related to Assets and 
Liabilities 
arising 
from 
a 
Single 
Transaction - Amendments to Ind AS 12
	
	
The amendments narrow the scope of 
the initial recognition exception under 
Ind AS 12, so that it no longer applies 
to transactions that give rise to equal 
taxable 
and 
deductible 
temporary 
differences such as leases. There 
was no impact of the change on the 
financial statements.
	
	
Apart 
from 
these, 
consequential 
amendments and editorials have been 
made to other Ind AS like Ind AS 101, 
Ind AS 102, Ind AS 103, Ind AS 107, Ind 
AS 109, Ind AS 115 and Ind AS 34.
2.2	 Business Combination and Goodwill
	
Business combinations (other than those 
under common control) are accounted for 
using the acquisition method under Ind AS 
103. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date 
fair value. Acquisition-related costs are 
expensed as incurred.
	
At the acquisition date, the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
are recognised at their acquisition date fair 
values. However, the following assets and 
liabilities acquired in a business combination 
are measured at the basis indicated below: 
 
 
The assets or liabilities related to 
employee benefit arrangements are 
recognised and measured in accordance 
with Ind AS 19 Employee Benefits.
 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognized and measured in accordance 
with Ind AS 12 Income Taxes.
	
When the Group acquires a business, it 
assesses the financial assets and liabilities 
assumed for appropriate classification 
and designation in accordance with the 
Annual Report 
2024
308
Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 342
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
contractual terms, economic circumstances 
and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition 
date. The consideration transferred by the 
acquirer is recognized at fair value at the 
acquisition date. Deferred consideration is 
classified as a liability under Ind AS 109 and 
is measured at amortized cost.
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, 
being the excess of the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred over the net 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed. After initial recognition, goodwill 
is measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for 
impairment annually or more frequently 
if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that they might be impaired.
	
For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination 
is, from the acquisition date, allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating 
units that are expected to benefit from 
the combination, irrespective of whether 
other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are 
assigned to those units.
	
A cash generating unit to which goodwill 
has been allocated is tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is 
an indication that the unit may be impaired. 
If the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit is less than its carrying 
amount, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to 
the other assets of the unit pro rata based 
on the carrying amount of each asset in 
the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill 
is recognised in statement of profit or loss. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill 
is not reversed in subsequent periods.
2.3 Basis of consolidation
	
Subsidiaries are all entities (including 
structured entities) over which the Group 
has Control. The determination of control 
for the purpose of consolidation is done as 
per Ind AS 110. Control is achieved when the 
Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee.
	
Specifically, the Group controls an investee 
if and only if the Group has:
	
a)	 Power over the investee (i.e. existing 
rights that give it the current ability 
to 
direct 
the 
relevant 
activities 
of the investee)
	
b)	 Exposure, 
or 
rights, 
to 
variable 
returns from its involvement with 
the investee, and
	
c)	 The ability to use its power over the 
investee to affect its returns
	
Generally, there is a presumption that a 
majority of voting rights result in control. 
To support this presumption and when 
the Group has less than a majority of the 
voting or similar rights of an investee, the 
Group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has 
power over an investee, including:
	
a)	 The contractual arrangement with the 
other vote holders of the investee
	
b)	 Rights arising from other contractual  
arrangements
Annual Report  
2024
309
Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 343
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
c)	 The Group’s voting rights and potential  
voting rights
	
d)	 The size of the group’s holding of 
voting rights relative to the size and 
dispersion of the holdings of the other 
voting rights holders
	
The 
Group 
re-assesses 
whether 
or 
not it controls an investee if facts and 
circumstances indicate that there are 
changes to one or more of the three 
elements of control. Consolidation of a 
subsidiary begins when the Group obtains 
control over the subsidiary and ceases when 
the Group loses control of the subsidiary. 
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of 
a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during 
the year are included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements from the date the 
Group gains control until the date the Group 
ceases to control the subsidiary. 
	
Consolidated Financial Statements are 
prepared using uniform accounting policies 
for like transactions and other events in 
similar circumstances. If a member of 
the group uses accounting policies other 
than those adopted in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements for like transactions 
and 
events 
in 
similar 
circumstances, 
appropriate adjustments are made to that 
group 
member’s 
Financial 
Statements 
in preparing the Consolidated Financial 
Statements to ensure conformity with the 
group’s accounting policies.
	
The Financial Statements of all entities 
used for the purpose of consolidation are 
drawn up to same reporting date as that of 
the Group. When the end of the reporting 
period of the parent is different from that 
of a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, for 
consolidation purposes, additional financial 
information as of the same date as the 
consolidated financial statements of the 
parent to enable the parent to consolidate 
the financial information of the subsidiary, 
unless it is impracticable to do so.
	
Consolidation procedures:
	
(a)	 Combine like items of assets, liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows 
of the parent with those of its subsidiaries. 
For this purpose, income and expenses of 
the subsidiary are based on the amounts 
of the assets and liabilities recognised in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements at 
the acquisition date.
	
(b)	 Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount 
of the parent’s investment in each 
subsidiary and the parent’s portion of 
equity of each subsidiary. 
	
(c)	 Eliminate in full intragroup assets and 
liabilities, equity, income, expenses 
and cash flows relating to transactions 
between entities of the group (profits 
or losses resulting from intragroup 
transactions that are recognised in 
Fixed assets, such as inventory and 
fixed assets, are eliminated in full). 
Intragroup losses may indicate an 
impairment that requires recognition in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Ind AS12 Income Taxes applies to 
temporary differences that arise from 
the elimination of profits and losses 
resulting from intragroup transactions.
	
Profit or loss and each component of other 
comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed 
Annual Report

Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 344
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
to the equity holders of the parent of the 
Group and to the non-controlling interests, 
even if this results in the non-controlling 
interests having a deficit balance. When 
necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries to 
bring their accounting policies into line 
with the Group’s accounting policies. All 
intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows relating 
to transactions between members of the 
Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. 
The 
Group 
measures 
non-controlling 
interests at their proportion of the fair value 
of the identifiable net assets. 
2.4 Investment in associates and 
joint ventures
	
An associate is an entity over which the 
Group has significant influence. Significant 
influence is the power to participate 
in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the investee, but is not control 
or joint control.
	
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement 
whereby the parties that have joint control 
of the arrangement have rights to the net 
assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an 
arrangement, which exists only when decisions 
about the relevant activities require unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control.
	
The considerations made in determining 
whether significant influence is similar to 
those necessary to determine control over 
the  Subsidiaries.
	
The Group’s investments in its associate 
and joint venture are accounted for using 
the equity method. Under the equity 
method, the investment in an associate or 
a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. 
	
The carrying amount of the investment 
is adjusted to recognise changes in the 
Group’s share of net assets of the associate 
or joint venture since the acquisition date. 
Goodwill relating to the associate or joint 
venture is included in the carrying amount 
of the investment and is not tested for 
impairment individually.
	
The consolidated statement of profit and 
loss reflects the Group’s share of the results 
of operations of the associate or joint 
venture. Any change in OCI of the associate 
or joint venture is presented as part of the 
Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has 
been a change recognised directly in the 
equity of the associate or joint venture, 
the Group recognises its share of any 
changes, when applicable, in the statement 
of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and 
losses resulting from transactions between 
the Group and the associate or joint venture 
are eliminated to the extent of the interest 
in the associate or joint venture.
	
If an entity’s share of losses of an associate 
or joint venture equals or exceeds its 
interest in the associate or joint venture 
(which includes any long term interest that, 
in substance, form part of the Group’s net 
investment in the associate), the entity 
discontinues recognising its share of further 
losses. Additional losses are recognised 
only to the extent that the Group has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations or 
made payments on behalf of the associate 
or joint venture. If the associate or joint

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
venture subsequently reports profits, the 
entity resumes recognising its share of 
those profits only after its share of the profits 
equals the share of losses not recognised.
	
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit 
or loss of an associate and joint venture 
is shown on the face of the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss. The financial 
statements of the associate and joint venture 
are prepared for the same reporting period 
as the Group. When necessary, adjustments 
are made to bring the accounting policies in 
line with those of the Group. 
	
After application of the equity method, the 
Group determines whether it is necessary 
to recognise an impairment loss on its 
investment in its associate or joint venture. At 
each reporting date, the Group determines 
whether there is objective evidence that 
the investment in the associate or joint 
venture is impaired.
	
If there is such evidence, the Group 
calculates the amount of impairment as the 
difference between the recoverable amount 
of the associate or joint venture and its 
carrying value, and then recognises the loss 
as ‘exceptional items’ in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss.
	
Upon loss of significant influence over 
the associate, the Group measures and 
recognises any retained investment at 
its fair value. Any difference between the 
carrying amount of the associate upon loss 
of significant influence and the fair value of 
the retained investment and proceeds from 
disposal is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss.
2.5 Summary of material accounting 
policies
	
a.	
Current versus non-current classification
	
	
The 
Group 
presents 
assets 
and 
liabilities in the consolidated balance 
sheet based on current / non-current 
classification. 
	
	
An asset is classified as current when it 
is expected to be realised or intended to 
be sold or consumed in normal operating 
cycle, held primarily for the purpose of 
trading, expected to be realised within 
twelve months after the reporting 
period, or cash or cash equivalent unless 
restricted from being exchanged or used 
to settle a liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period. All 
other assets are classified as non-current.
	
	
A liability is classified as current when 
it is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle, it is held primarily 
for the purpose of trading, it is due 
to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or there 
is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting 
period. The Group classifies all other 
liabilities as non-current.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities, 
are classified as non-current assets 
and liabilities.
	
	
The operating cycle is the time between 
the acquisition of assets for processing 
and their realisation in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Group has identified 
twelve months as its operating cycle.

b.	
Foreign currencies
	
	
Functional and presentation currency
	
	
Items included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the Group 
are measured using the currency of 
the primary economic environment in 
which it operates i.e. the “functional 
currency”. The Group’s consolidated 
financial statements are presented 
in INR, which is also the Holding 
Company’s functional currency.
	
	
Transactions and balances
	
	
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
initially recorded by the Group’s entities 
at their respective functional currency 
at exchange rates prevailing at the 
date the transaction first qualifies 
for recognition.
	
	
Monetary 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the functional currency 
spot rates of exchange at the reporting 
date. Exchange differences arising on 
settlement or translation of monetary 
items are recognised in profit or loss.
	
	
Non-monetary items that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the dates of the 
initial transactions. 
	
	
Non-monetary items measured at fair 
value in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the date 
when the fair value is determined. 
The gain or loss arising on translation 
of non-monetary items measured at 
fair value is treated in line with the 
recognition of the gain or loss on the 
change in fair value of the item (i.e., 
translation differences on items whose 
fair value gain or loss is recognised in 
other comprehensive income (“OCI”) 
or consolidated statement of profit 
and loss, are also recognised in OCI or 
consolidated statement of profit and 
loss, respectively).
	
	
Group companies
	
	
On consolidation, the assets and 
liabilities of foreign operations are 
translated into INR at the rate of 
exchange prevailing at the reporting 
date and their consolidated statements 
of profit and loss are translated at 
exchange rates prevailing at the dates 
of the transactions. The exchange 
differences arising on translation for 
consolidation are recognised in OCI. 
On disposal of a foreign operation, 
the component of OCI relating to 
that particular foreign operation is 
recognised in profit or loss.
	
c.	
Fair value measurement
	
	
The Group measures certain financial 
instruments (e.g. investments) at fair 
value at each balance sheet date. 
	
	
Fair value is the price that would 
be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. 
	
	
The fair value measurement is based on 
the presumption that the transaction to 
sell the asset or transfer the liabilities 
takes place either in the principal 
Annual Report  
2024

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
market for the asset or liability or in 
absence of principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the 
asset or liability.
	
	
A fair value measurement of a non-
financial asset takes into account a 
market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to 
another market participant that would 
use the asset in its highest and best use.
	
	
The Group uses valuation techniques 
that 
are 
appropriate 
in 
the 
circumstances and for which sufficient 
data are available to measure fair 
value, maximising the use of relevant 
observable inputs and minimising the 
use of unobservable inputs.
	
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair 
value is measured or disclosed in the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, 
described 
as 
follows, 
based on the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
	
	
Level 1- Quoted (Unadjusted) marked 
prices in the active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities
	
	
Level 2- Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement is directly 
or indirectly observable
	
	
Level 3- Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant 
to 
the 
fair 
value 
measurement 
is unobservable.
	
	
For 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
that 
are 
recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements on a recurring basis, the 
Group determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy 
by re-assessing categorisation (based on 
the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) at 
the end of each reporting period.
	
	
At 
each 
reporting 
date, 
the 
management analyses the movements 
in the values of assets and liabilities 
which are required to be re-measured 
or re-assessed as per the Group’s 
accounting policies. For this analysis, 
the management or its expert verifies 
the major inputs applied in the latest 
valuation by agreeing the information in 
the valuation computation to contracts 
and other relevant documents.
	
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, 
the Group has determined classes of 
assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the 
asset or liability and the level of the fair 
value hierarchy as explained above.
	
d.	
Revenue recognition
	
	
Revenue is measured based on the 
consideration specified in a contract 
with a customer (transaction price) net 
of variable consideration e.g. discounts, 
volume rebates, any payments made to 
a customer (unless the payment is for a 
distinct good or service received from 
the customer) and excludes amounts 
collected on behalf of third parties. 
The Group recognises revenue when 
it transfers control over a product or 
Annual Report 
2024

Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 348
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
service to a customer. Revenue is only 
recognised to the extent that it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal 
will not occur.
	
	
The Group provides incentives to 
its users in various forms including 
cashbacks. 
Incentives 
which 
are 
consideration payable to the customer 
that are not in exchange for a 
distinct good or service are generally 
recognized as a reduction of revenue.
	
	
Where the Group acts as an agent 
for selling goods or services, only 
the commission income is included 
within revenue. The specific revenue 
recognition criteria described below 
must also be met before revenue is 
recognized. Typically, the Group has 
a right to payment before or at the 
point that services are delivered. 
Cash received before the services are 
delivered is recognised as a contract 
liability. The amount of consideration 
does not contain a significant financing 
component as payment terms are less 
than one year. 
	
	
Sale of services 
	
	
Revenue from services is recognized 
when 
the 
control 
in 
services 
is 
transferred as per the terms of the 
agreement with customer i.e. as and 
when services are rendered. Revenues 
are disclosed net of the Goods and 
Services Tax charged on such services. 
In terms of the contract, excess of 
revenue over the billed at the year-
end is carried in the balance sheet as 
trade receivables where the amount is 
recoverable from the customer without 
any 
future 
performance 
obligation 
and the Group has unconditional right 
over such consideration (i.e. if only 
the passage of time is required before 
payment of such consideration is due). 
Cash received before the services 
are delivered is recognised as a 
contract liability.
	
	
Commission
	
	
The Group facilitates recharge of 
talk time, bill payments, availability 
of bus tickets and sale of deal 
coupons and earns commission for 
the respective services. Commission 
income 
is 
recognized 
when 
the 
control in services is transferred to the 
customer when the services have been 
provided by the Group.
	
	
Service fees from merchants
	
	
The Group earns service fee from 
merchants and recognizes such revenue 
when the control in services have been 
transferred by the Group i.e. as and 
when services have been provided 
by the Group. Such service fee is 
generally determined as a percentage 
of transaction value executed by the 
merchants. Amount received by the 
Group pending settlement are disclosed 
as payable to the merchants under other 
financial liabilities.
	
	
Revenue from broking activities
	
	
Revenue 
from 
broking 
activities, 
fees and delayed payment charges 
is recognized on the trade date of 
transaction (net of Goods & service

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
tax (GST), securities transaction tax, 
stamp duties and other levies by SEBI 
and stock exchanges). Revenue from 
platform fees are received periodically 
but are recognized as earned on 
pro-rata basis over the term of the 
contract i.e. one year.
	
	
Government Grants
	
	
The Group recognises government 
grants only when there is reasonable 
assurance that the conditions attached 
to them will be complied with, and the 
grants will be received. Government 
grants 
related 
to 
revenue 
are 
recognized on a systematic basis in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss as other operating revenue over 
the periods necessary to match them 
with the related costs, if any, which 
they are intended to compensate.
	
	
Interest income
	
	
For all debt instruments measured either 
at amortised cost or at fair value through 
other comprehensive income, interest 
income is recorded using the effective 
interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that 
exactly discounts the estimated future 
cash payments or receipts over the 
expected life of the financial instrument 
or a shorter period, where appropriate, 
to the gross carrying amount of the 
financial asset or to the amortised cost 
of a financial liability. When calculating 
the effective interest rate, the Group 
estimates the expected cash flows by 
considering all the contractual terms of 
the financial instrument but does not 
consider the expected credit losses. 
Interest income is included in other 
income in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.
	
e.	
Trade receivable
	
	
Trade receivables are amounts due 
from customers for services performed 
in the ordinary course of business and 
reflects group’s unconditional right to 
consideration (that is, payment is due 
only on the passage of time). Trade 
receivables are recognised initially at the 
transaction price as they do not contain 
significant financing components. The 
group holds the trade receivables with 
the objective of collecting the contractual 
cash flows and therefore measures 
them subsequently at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, less 
loss allowance. 
	
f.	
Taxes
	
	
Current income tax
	
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities 
are measured at the amount expected to 
be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws 
used to compute the amount are those 
that are enacted or substantively enacted, 
at the reporting date in the countries 
where the Group operates and generates 
taxable income.
	
	
Current income tax relating to items 
recognised 
outside 
consolidated 
statement of profit and loss is recognised 
either in other comprehensive income 
or in equity. Current tax items are 
recognised 
in 
correlation 
to 
the 
underlying transaction either in OCI 
Annual Report 
2024
316
Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 350
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
or directly in equity. Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in 
the tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are 
subject to interpretation and considers 
whether it is probable that a taxation 
authority will accept an uncertain tax 
treatment. The Group measures its 
tax balances either based on the most 
likely amount or the expected value, 
depending on which method provides 
a better prediction of the resolution of 
the uncertainty.
	
	
Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred tax is provided using the liability 
method 
on 
temporary 
differences 
between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts 
for financial reporting purposes at the 
reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities 
are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences, except:
 
 
When the deferred tax liability 
arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of 
the transaction, affects neither 
the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss.
 
 
In respect of taxable temporary 
differences 
associated 
with 
investments 
in 
subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint 
ventures, when the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and 
it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for 
all deductible temporary differences, 
the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry 
forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses can be utilised, The 
carrying amount of deferred tax assets 
is reviewed at each reporting date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit 
will be available to allow all or part of 
the deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are 
re-assessed at each reporting date and 
are recognised to the extent that it has 
become probable that future taxable 
profits will allow the deferred tax asset 
to be recovered.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are not recognised 
for temporary differences between 
the carrying amount and tax bases of 
investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and interest in joint arrangements where 
it is not probable that the differences 
will reverse in the foreseeable future 
and taxable profit will not be available 
against which the temporary difference 
can be utilised.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the year when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, 
Annual Report  
2024

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 351
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised 
outside consolidated statement of profit 
and loss is recognised either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity. 
Deferred tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction 
either in OCI or directly in equity.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred 
tax liabilities are offset if a legally 
enforceable right exists to set off 
current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and the deferred taxes relate 
to the same taxable entity and the 
same taxation authority.
	
	
Taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on 
incurring expenses
	
	
Assets are recognised net of the 
amount of GST paid, except when the 
tax incurred on a purchase of assets 
is not recoverable from the taxation 
authority, in which case, the tax paid 
is recognised as part of the cost of 
acquisition of the asset.
	
	
Expenses are recognised net of the 
amount of GST paid, except when the tax 
incurred on a purchase of services is not 
recoverable from the taxation authority, 
in which case, the tax paid is expensed 
off in statement of profit and loss.
	
	
The net amount of tax recoverable from, 
or payable to, the taxation authority is 
included as part of other current/ non- 
current assets or other current liabilities 
in the consolidated balance sheet.
	
g.	
Property, plant and equipment
	
	
Property, plant and equipment are 
carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment, if any. Property, plant and 
equipment is depreciated on a written 
down value basis to its residual value 
over its estimated useful life.
	
	
Cost directly attributable to acquisition 
are capitalised until the property, plant 
and equipment are ready for use, as 
intended by the management. 
	
	
Subsequent costs are capitalised on 
the carrying amount or recognised 
as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when future economic benefits 
associated with the item are probable 
to flow to the Group and cost of the 
item can be measured reliably. When 
significant parts of property, plant and 
equipment are required to be replaced 
at intervals, the Group depreciates 
them separately based on their specific 
useful lives. The carrying amount of 
any component accounted for as a 
separate asset is derecognised when 
replaced. All repair and maintenance 
are charged to consolidated statement 
of profit and loss during the reporting 
period in which they are incurred.
	
	
Advances paid towards the acquisition 
of property, plant and equipment 
outstanding at each balance sheet 
date is classified as capital advances 
under the non-current assets and the 
cost of assets not ready to use before 
such date are disclosed under ‘Capital 
work in progress’.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or 
retirement of an item of property, plant 
and equipment is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset 
and is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss on the date 
of disposal or retirement.
	
	
Depreciation is provided using the 
written down value method except for 
plant and machinery on which straight 
line method is used, based on technical 
evaluation done by the management 
and charged to consolidated statement 
of profit and loss as per the useful life 
prescribed under schedule II of the 
Companies Act, 2013, given below:

Leasehold 
improvements 
are 
depreciated over the shorter of their 
useful life or the lease term, unless the 
entity expects to use the assets beyond 
the lease term.
	
	
During the previous year, the Holding 
Company had changed the method of 
depreciation for Plant & Machinery from 
written down value method to straight 
line method along with change in life to 3 
years and 2 years for EDC/POS machines 
and Soundbox, respectively and the 
impact on account of such change in 
estimate was assessed to be immaterial 
for the current and future periods.
	
	
The residual values, useful lives and 
methods of depreciation of property, 
plant and equipment are reviewed at 
each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
	
h.	
Intangible assets
	
	
Separately acquired intangible assets, 
such as software are measured initially 
at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost 
less 
accumulated 
amortization 
and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Costs 
associated 
with 
maintaining 
software programmes are recognised as 
an expense as incurred. Development 
costs that are directly attributable to the 
design and testing of identifiable and 
unique software products controlled by 
the Group are recognised as intangible 
assets where the following criteria are met:
 
 
it is technically feasible to complete 
the software so that it will be 
available for use or sale
 
 
management intends to complete 
the software and use or sell it
 
 
there is an ability to use or 
sell the software
 
 
it can be demonstrated how the 
software will generate probable 
future economic benefits
Annual Report  
2024

Financial Statements

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
 
 
adequate technical, financial and 
other resources to complete the 
development and to use or sell the 
software are available, and
 
 
the expenditure attributable to the 
software during its development 
can be reliably measured.
	
	
Directly attributable costs that are 
capitalised as part of the software 
include employee costs.
	
	
Research and development costs
	
	
Research expenditure and development 
expenditure that do not meet the 
criteria above are recognised as an 
expense as incurred. Development 
costs previously recognised as an 
expense are not recognised as an asset 
in a subsequent period.
	
	
Amortization methods and periods
	
	
Amortization of intangible assets begins 
when development is complete and 
the asset is available for use. Software, 
licenses 
acquired 
and 
internally 
generated software are amortized at 
the rate of 40% per annum on written 
down value method. During the period 
of development, the asset is tested for 
impairment annually. The amortization 
period and the amortization method are 
reviewed at least at each financial year 
end. Changes in the expected useful life 
or the expected pattern of consumption 
of future economic benefits embodied 
in the asset are considered to modify 
the amortization period or method, as 
appropriate, and are treated as changes 
in accounting estimates. The amortization 
expense 
on 
intangible 
assets 
is 
recognized in the statement of profit and 
loss unless such expenditure forms part 
of carrying value of another asset.
	
	
Gains or losses arising from de-
recognition of an intangible asset are 
measured as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and are recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss when 
the asset is derecognized.
	
i.	
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
	
For all non-financial assets, the Group 
assesses whether there are indicators 
of impairment. If such an indicator exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss, if any. Where the 
asset does not generate cash flows that 
are independent from other assets, the 
Group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to 
which the asset belongs. 
	
	
The recoverable amount for an asset or 
CGU is the higher of its value in use and 
fair value less costs of disposal. If the 
recoverable amount of an asset or CGU 
is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount or CGU the asset is considered 
impaired and the carrying amount 
of the asset or CGU is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss 
is 
recognised 
immediately 
in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss. 
	
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows of the asset or CGU are

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset. In determining fair value 
less costs of disposal, recent market 
transactions are taken into account. If 
no such transactions can be identified, 
an appropriate valuation model is used. 
These calculations are corroborated by 
valuation multiples, quoted share prices 
for publicly traded companies or other 
available fair value indicators.
	
	
The 
Group 
bases 
its 
impairment 
calculation on detailed budgets and 
forecast calculations. These budgets 
and forecast calculations generally 
cover a period of five years. For longer 
periods, a long-term growth rate is 
calculated and applied to project 
future cash flows after the fifth year. 
To estimate cash flow projections 
beyond periods covered by the most 
recent budgets/forecasts, the Group 
extrapolates cash flow projections in 
the budget using a steady or declining 
growth rate for subsequent years, 
unless an increasing rate can be 
justified. In any case, this growth rate 
does not exceed the long-term average 
growth rate for the products, industries, 
or country or countries in which the 
entity operates, or for the market in 
which the asset is used.
	
	
An assessment is made at each 
reporting date to determine whether 
there is an indication that previously 
recognised 
impairment 
losses 
no 
longer exist or have decreased. If such 
indication exists, the Group estimates 
the 
asset’s 
or 
CGU’s 
recoverable 
amount. 
A 
previously 
recognised 
impairment loss is reversed only if there 
has been a change in the assumptions 
used to determine the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount since the last 
impairment loss was recognised. The 
reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed 
its recoverable amount, nor exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had 
no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset in prior years. Such reversal 
is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss. 
	
j.	
Provisions and contingencies
	
	
Provisions
	
	
Provisions are recognised when the 
Group has a present obligation (legal 
or constructive) as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. 
When the Group expects some or 
all of a provision to be reimbursed, 
the reimbursement is recognised as 
a separate asset, but only when the 
reimbursement 
is 
virtually 
certain. 
The expense relating to a provision 
is 
presented 
in 
the 
consolidated 
statement of profit and loss net of any 
reimbursement. If the effect of the time 
value of money is material, provisions 
are discounted using a current pre-tax 
rate that reflects, when appropriate,

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
the risks specific to the liability. When 
discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a finance cost.
	
	
Contingencies
	
	
A contingent liability is a possible 
obligation that arises from past events 
whose existence will be confirmed by 
the occurrence or non-occurrence of 
one or more uncertain future events 
beyond the control of the Group or a 
present obligation that is not recognized 
because it is not probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation. A contingent 
liability also arises in extremely rare 
cases where there is a liability that 
cannot be recognized because it cannot 
be measured reliably. The Group does 
not recognize a contingent liability 
but discloses its existence in the 
consolidated financial Statements.
	
k.	
Retirement and other employee benefits
	
	
For defined benefit plans (gratuity), 
the liability or asset recognised in the 
balance sheet is the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation at the end of 
the reporting period less the fair value 
of plan assets. The defined benefit 
obligation is calculated by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. 
	
	
The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows by 
reference to market yields at the end 
of the reporting period on government 
bonds that have terms approximating 
to the terms of the related obligation.
	
	
The net interest cost is calculated by 
applying the discount rate to the net 
balance of the defined benefit obligation 
and the fair value of plan assets. This 
cost is included in employee benefit 
expense in the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss.
	
	
Remeasurement gains and losses arising 
from 
experience 
adjustments 
and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are 
recognised in the period in which they 
occur, directly in other comprehensive 
income. They are included in retained 
earnings in the statement of changes 
in equity and in the balance sheet. Re-
measurements are not reclassified to 
profit or loss in subsequent periods.
	
	
Changes in the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation resulting 
from plan amendments or curtailments 
are recognised immediately in profit or 
loss as past service cost.
	
	
The Group’s contributions to defined 
contribution plans (provident fund) 
are recognized in profit or loss when 
the employee renders related service. 
The Group has no further obligations 
under 
these 
plans 
beyond 
its 
periodic contributions.
	
	
The Group provides for liability at year 
end on account of un-availed earned 
leave and Long Term Incentive Plan 
(‘LTIP’) as per actuarial valuation using 
projected unit credit method.

Liabilities for wages and salaries, 
including non-monetary benefits that 
are expected to be settled wholly within 
12 months after the end of the period in 
which the employees render the related 
service are recognised in respect of 
employees' services up to the end of the 
reporting period and are measured at 
the amounts expected to be paid when 
the liabilities are settled. The liabilities 
are presented as employee benefit 
payable under other financial liabilities 
in the consolidated balance sheet.
	
	
The 
Code 
on 
Social 
Security, 
2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee 
benefits 
during 
employment 
and 
post-employment 
benefits 
received 
Presidential assent in September 2020. 
The Code has been published in the 
Gazette of India. Certain sections of the 
Code came into effect on May 03, 2023. 
However, the final rules/interpretation 
have not yet been issued. Based on 
a preliminary assessment, the entity 
believes the impact of the change will 
not be significant.
	
l.	
Share-based payments
	
	
Equity-settled transactions
	
	
Employees (including senior executives) 
of the Group receive remuneration in 
the form of share-based payments, 
whereby employees render services 
as consideration for equity instruments 
(equity-settled transactions).
	
	
The cost of equity-settled transactions 
is determined by the fair value at the 
date when the grant is made using an 
appropriate valuation model.
	
	
That cost is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in 
Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) 
reserves in equity, over the period in 
which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee 
benefits 
expense. 
The 
cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date 
until the vesting date reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Group’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The consolidated 
statement of profit and loss expense 
or credit for a period represents the 
movement 
in 
cumulative 
expense 
recognised as at the beginning and 
end of that period and is recognised in 
employee benefits expense.
	
	
Performance 
conditions 
which 
are 
market conditions are taken into account 
when determining the grant date fair 
value of the awards. Service and non-
market performance conditions are not 
taken into account when determining 
the grant date fair value of awards, but 
the likelihood of the conditions being 
met is assessed as part of the Group’s 
best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest.
	
	
No expense is recognised for awards 
that do not ultimately vest because 
non-market 
performance 
and/or 
service conditions have not been met.
	
	
When the terms of an equity-settled 
award are modified, the minimum expense 
recognised is the expense had the terms

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
not been modified, if the original terms of 
the award are met. An additional expense 
is recognised for any modification that 
increases the total fair value of the 
share-based payment transaction, or is 
otherwise beneficial to the employee as 
measured at the date of modification. 
	
	
Where an award is cancelled by the 
entity or by the counterparty, any 
remaining element of the fair value of 
the award is expensed immediately 
through profit or loss.
	
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected as additional share 
dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
	
m.	 Financial instruments
	
	
A financial instrument is any contract 
that gives rise to a financial asset of 
one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.
	
	
Financial assets
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
All financial assets are recognised 
initially at fair value plus, in the case of 
financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs 
that are attributable to the acquisition 
of the financial asset. However, trade 
receivables that do not contain a 
significant financing component are 
measured at transaction price.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
For 
purposes 
of 
subsequent 
measurement, 
financial 
assets 
are 
classified in four categories:
 
 
Debt instruments at amortized cost
 
 
Debt instruments at fair value 
through 
other 
comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI)
 
 
Debt instruments, derivatives and 
equity instruments at fair value 
through profit or loss (FVTPL)
 
 
Equity instruments measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI)
	
	
Debt instruments at amortised cost
	
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the 
amortised cost if both the following 
conditions are met:
	
	
a)	 The asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold 
assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
	
	
b)	 Contractual terms of the asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial 
assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised 
cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral 
part of the EIR. The EIR amortization 
is included in finance income in the 
profit or loss. The losses arising from 
impairment are recognised in the profit 
or loss. This category generally applies 
Annual Report 
2024
324
Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 358
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
to trade and other receivables and is 
most relevant to the Group.
	
	
Debt instrument at FVTOCI
	
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at 
the FVTOCI if both of the following 
criteria are met:
	
	
a)	 The objective of the business model 
is achieved both by collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling 
the financial assets, and
	
	
b)	 The asset’s contractual cash flows 
represent SPPI.
	
	
Debt instruments included within the 
FVTOCI category are measured initially 
as well as at each reporting date at 
fair value. Fair value movements are 
recognized in the other comprehensive 
income (OCI). However, the Group 
recognizes 
interest 
income, 
impairment losses and reversals and 
foreign exchange gain or loss in the 
consolidated statement of profit and 
loss. On derecognition of the asset, 
cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in OCI is reclassified from 
the equity to consolidated statement 
of profit and loss. Interest earned 
whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument 
is reported as interest income using 
the EIR method.
	
	
Debt instrument at FVTPL
	
	
FVTPL is a residual category for debt 
instruments. 
Any 
debt 
instrument, 
which does not meet the criteria for 
categorization as at amortized cost or 
as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
	
	
In addition, the Group may elect to 
designate a debt instrument, which 
otherwise meets amortized cost or 
FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, 
such election is allowed only if doing so 
reduces or eliminates a measurement 
or recognition inconsistency (referred 
to as ‘accounting mismatch’). 
	
	
Debt instruments included within the 
FVTPL category are measured at fair 
value with all changes recognized 
in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
Equity investments
	
	
All equity investments in scope of Ind 
AS 109 are measured at fair value. The 
Group may make an irrevocable election 
to present in other comprehensive 
income subsequent changes in the fair 
value. The Group makes such election 
on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
The classification is made on initial 
recognition and is irrevocable.
	
	
If the Group decides to classify an equity 
instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value 
changes on the instrument, excluding 
dividends, are recognized in the OCI. 
There is no recycling of the amounts 
from OCI to consolidated statement of 
profit or loss, even on sale of investment. 
However, the Group may transfer the 
cumulative gain or loss within equity.
	
	
Equity instruments included within 
the FVTPL category are measured at 
fair value with all changes recognized 
in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
The equity securities which are not held 
for trading, and for which the Group has 
made an irrevocable election at initial 
recognition to recognize changes in fair 
value through OCI rather than profit or 
loss as these are strategic investments 
and the Group considered this to 
be more relevant.
	
	
Equity investments in associates and 
joint ventures are measured at cost. 
The investments are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment 
considering the provisions of Ind AS 
36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. If any such 
indication exists, policy for impairment 
of non-financial assets is followed.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, 
a part of a financial asset or part of a 
group of similar financial assets) is 
primarily derecognised (i.e. removed 
from 
the 
Group’s 
consolidated 
balance sheet) when:
 
 
The rights to receive cash flows 
from the asset have expired, or
 
 
The Group has transferred its 
rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash 
flows in full without material delay 
to a third party under a ‘pass-
through’ arrangement; and either 
(a) the Group has transferred 
substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or (b) the 
Group has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
	
	
When the Group has transferred its 
rights to receive cash flows from an 
asset or has entered into a pass-
through arrangement, it evaluates if 
and to what extent it has retained the 
risks and rewards of ownership. When 
it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of the asset, nor transferred control 
of the asset, the Group continues to 
recognise the transferred asset to 
the extent of the Group’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Group also 
recognises an associated liability. The 
transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that 
the Group has retained.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the 
Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) 
model for measurement and recognition 
of impairment loss on financial assets 
that are debt instruments, and are 
measured at amortised cost e.g., 
loans, debt securities, deposits, trade 
receivables and bank balance.
	
	
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ 
for recognition of impairment loss 
allowance on trade receivables. The 
application of simplified approach does 
not require the Group to track changes 
in credit risk. Rather, it recognises 
impairment loss allowance based on 
lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, 
right from its initial recognition. 
Annual Report 
2024
326
Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 360
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
For recognition of impairment loss 
on other financial assets and risk 
exposure, the Group determines that 
whether there has been a significant 
increase in the credit risk since initial 
recognition. If credit risk has not 
increased 
significantly, 
12-month 
expected credit loss (ECL) is used to 
provide for impairment loss. However, 
if credit risk has increased significantly, 
lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent 
period, credit quality of the instrument 
improves such that there is no longer 
a significant increase in credit risk 
since initial recognition, then the entity 
reverts to recognising impairment loss 
allowance based on 12-month ECL.
	
	
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit 
losses resulting from all possible 
default events over the expected life 
of a financial instrument. The 12-month 
ECL is a portion of the lifetime ECL 
which results from default events that 
are possible within 12 months after the 
reporting date.
	
	
ECL is the difference between all 
contractual cash flows that are due 
to the Group in accordance with the 
contract and all the cash flows that 
the entity expects to receive (i.e., 
all cash shortfalls), discounted at 
the original EIR.
	
	
The Group uses a provision matrix to 
determine impairment loss allowance 
on portfolio of its trade receivables. 
The provision matrix is based on its 
historically observed default rates over 
the expected life of the trade receivables 
and is adjusted for forward-looking 
estimates. At every reporting date, the 
historical observed default rates are 
updated and changes in the forward-
looking estimates are analysed.
	
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or 
reversal) recognized during the period 
is recognized as income/ expense in 
the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss. This amount is reflected 
under the head other expenses in the 
consolidated statement of profit and 
loss. For the financial assets measured 
as at amortised cost ECL is presented 
as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part 
of the measurement of those assets in 
the consolidated balance sheet. The 
allowance reduces the net carrying 
amount. Until the asset meets write-
off criteria, the Group does not reduce 
impairment allowance from the gross 
carrying amount.
	
	
Financial liabilities
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at 
initial recognition, as financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings, payables, or 
as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, 
as appropriate.
	
	
All financial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value and, in the 
case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs.

Financial Statements

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
The Group’s financial liabilities include 
borrowings, lease liabilities, trade and 
other payables.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities 
depends on their classification as 
described below: 
	
	
Loans and borrowings
	
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using 
the EIR method. Gains and losses are 
recognised in profit or loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through the EIR amortisation process. 
	
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included as finance 
costs in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised 
when the obligation under the liability 
is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is 
replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, 
or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an 
exchange or modification is treated 
as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new 
liability. The difference in the respective 
carrying amounts is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities 
are offset and the net amount is reported 
in the consolidated balance sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal 
right to offset the recognised amounts 
and there is an intention to settle on 
a net basis, to realise the assets and 
settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	
n.	
Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the 
consolidated balance sheet comprise 
cash at banks and on hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less, which are 
subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
	
	
For the purpose of the consolidated 
statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and short-
term deposits, as defined above, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts as they are 
considered an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management.
	
o.	
Leases
	
	
The Group as a lessee
	
	
The 
Group’s 
lease 
asset 
classes 
primarily consist of leases for land and 
office premises. The Group assesses 
whether a contract contains a lease, 
at inception of a contract. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration. To assess 
whether a contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset, 
Annual Report 
2024
328
Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 362
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
the Group assesses whether: (i) the 
contact involves the use of an identified 
asset (ii) the Group has substantially 
all of the economic benefits from use 
of the asset through the period of the 
lease and (iii) the Group has the right to 
direct the use of the asset.
	
	
At the date of commencement of the 
lease, the Group recognizes a right-of-
use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding 
lease liability for all lease arrangements 
in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less 
(short-term leases) and low value 
leases. For these short-term and low 
value leases, the Group recognizes 
the lease payments as an operating 
expense on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease.
	
	
Certain lease arrangements includes 
the options to extend or terminate the 
lease before the end of the lease term. 
ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably 
certain that they will be exercised.
	
	
The right-of-use assets are initially 
recognized at cost, which comprises 
the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made 
at or prior to the commencement 
date of the lease plus any initial direct 
costs less any lease incentives. They 
are subsequently measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any.
	
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated 
from the commencement date on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of 
the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. Right of use assets are 
evaluated for recoverability whenever 
events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amounts may 
not be recoverable. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, the recoverable 
amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value 
less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is 
determined on an individual asset basis 
unless the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are largely independent of 
those from other assets. In such cases, 
the recoverable amount is determined 
for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to 
which the asset belongs.
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured 
at amortized cost at the present value 
of the future lease payments. The 
lease payments are discounted using 
the interest rate implicit in the lease 
or, if not readily determinable, using 
the incremental borrowing rates in the 
country of domicile of these leases. 
Lease liabilities are remeasured with 
a corresponding adjustment to the 
related right of use asset if the Group 
changes its assessment if whether 
it will exercise an extension or a 
termination option.
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have 
been separately presented in the 
consolidated balance sheet and lease 
payments have been classified as 
financing cash flows.

Earnings/ (loss) per share (EPS)
	
	
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by 
dividing the profit/ (loss) for the year

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
attributable to equity holders of Holding 
Company by the weighted average 
number of Equity shares outstanding 
during the year.
	
	
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by 
dividing the profit/ (loss) attributable to 
equity holders of Holding Company by 
the weighted average number of Equity 
shares outstanding during the year 
plus the weighted average number of 
Equity shares that would be issued on 
conversion of all the dilutive potential 
Equity shares into Equity shares.
	
q.	
Segment reporting
	
	
Operating segments are reported in 
a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The Chief Operating 
decision-maker 
is 
responsible 
for 
allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments 
and makes strategic decisions.
	
r.	
Use of estimates 
	
	
The Group is required to make estimates 
and 
assumptions 
that 
affect 
the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
disclosure of contingent liabilities at 
the date of the consolidated financial 
statements and the reported amounts 
of revenue and expenses during the 
reporting period. Actual results could 
differ 
from 
those 
estimates. 
The 
Group bases its estimates on historical 
experience 
and 
on 
various 
other 
assumptions that are believed to be 
reasonable, the results of which form 
the basis for making judgements about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities.
	
s.	
Exceptional Items
	
	
On certain occasions, the size, type 
or incidence of an item of income or 
expense, pertaining to the ordinary 
activities of the Group is such that its 
disclosure improves the understanding 
of the performance of the Group. Such 
income or expense is classified as 
an exceptional item and accordingly 
disclosed in the consolidated financial 
statements. Significant impact on the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
arising from impairment and non-
recurring events are considered and 
reported as exceptional items.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
3 (b). Leases (Contd..)
	
The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Group becomes 
obliged to exercise (or not exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty is only revised if a 
significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs, which affects this assessment, and 
that is within the control of the lessee. The Group has given notice to vacate certain office premises. 
This has been accounted as lease termination. Hence, in accordance with Ind AS 116, Lease Liability 
has been re-measured by INR 204 (March 31, 2023: 9) with corresponding adjustment to Right of 
use assets amounting to INR 185 (March 31, 2023: 24) and the remaining balance has been included 
in Miscellaneous Income disclosed under Other Income in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
The total cash outflow for leases for the year is INR 519 (March 31, 2023: 638)
	
Extension and termination options:
	
Extension and termination options are included in certain leases. These are used to maximise 
operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s operations. In certain 
cases, the extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by 
the respective lessor.

Securities premium is used to record the premium on issue of shares. The reserve is utilised in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act.
(ii)	 Employee stock options outstanding account (ESOP Reserve)
	
Employee stock options outstanding account is used to recognise the grant date fair value of 
options issued to employees under the One 97 Employee Stock Option Plan.
(iii)	FVTOCI Reserve
	
The Holding Company has elected to recognise changes in the fair values of the certain 
investments in equity instruments in other comprehensive income. These changes are 
accumulated within the FVTOCI reserve within equity. The Holding Company transfers amounts 
from this reserve to retained earning when relevant equity securities are derecognised.
(iv)	Capital Redemption Reserve
	
As per Companies Act, 2013, capital redemption reserve is created when company purchases 
its own shares out of free reserves or securities premium. A sum equal to the nominal value of 
the shares so purchased is transferred to capital redemption reserve. The reserve is utilised in 
accordance with the provisions of section 69 of the Companies Act, 2013.
(v)	 FCTR Reserve
	
Exchange differences arising on translation of assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the 
Group’s foreign subsidiaries are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated

As at March 31, 2024, the Holding Company had balances recoverable of INR 139 from Go Airlines 
(India) Limited (“Go Air”) towards business related advances given and other dues. After considering 
recoveries and adjustments in the normal course of business during the year, the recoverable 
balance stands at INR 57 as on date. On May 10, 2023, the National Company Law Tribunal, Delhi 
Bench (‘NCLT’) admitted Go Air’s application for voluntary insolvency proceedings under the 
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016, and NCLT has also appointed an Insolvency Resolution 
Professional (IRP) to revive the airline and manage its operations. As at date, the sale of tickets has 
been suspended and flights are yet to resume for Go Air. As part of the claims process, on May 24, 
2023, the Holding Company has filed a claim with the IRP for recovery of outstanding balances. 
Pending outcome of the insolvency proceedings, the management has provided for the balance 
INR 57 as exceptional item in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
21. Earnings per shares (EPS)
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity 
holders of the Holding Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) attributable to equity holders of the 
Holding Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year 
plus the weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued on conversion of all the 
dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
22. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, 
assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next 12 months, are described below.
Deferred taxes and Income taxes
Deferred tax assets can be recognised for deductible temporary differences (including unused tax 
losses) only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary difference can be utilized. Most of the companies forming part of the Group are 
yet to generate operating profits, Management has assessed that as at March 31, 2024 it is not probable 
that such deferred tax assets can be realised in excess of available taxable temporary differences. 
Management re-assesses unrecognized deferred tax assets at each reporting date and recognizes to 
the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be 
recovered. For details about deferred tax assets, refer note 28.
During FY 2019-20 (AY 2020-21) a shareholder of the Holding Company holding 30.33% of shares 
of the Holding Company had transferred its shareholding to its group company (both entities being 
100% subsidiaries of the same ultimate parent entity). Based on advice from the Holding Company's tax 
experts, Management has assessed that a mere change in shareholding within the same group will not 
be an affirmative position to say that the shareholding has been changed. Further, since the shares of 
the Holding Company carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power were beneficially held 
by persons, i.e. ultimate holding company of the aforesaid entities, who beneficially held shares of the 
Holding Company carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power on the last day of the year 
or years in which the loss was incurred, the Holding Company shall be entitled to carry forward and set 
off these losses against the taxable income of future years in accordance with the provisions of Section 
79 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. (refer note 28)
Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits) 
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are 
determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that 
may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, 
future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its 
long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All 
assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated, the management considers the interest rates of 
government bonds. The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. The mortality tables tend 
to change only at interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases 
are based on expected future inflation rates. For further details about gratuity obligations, refer note 27.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance 
sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured 
using valuation techniques including the DCF model, Price of Recent Investment (PORI) method and 
Comparable Company Multiples (CCM) method. The inputs to these models are taken from observable 
markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing 
fair values. For further details about Fair value measurement, refer note 31.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit risks associated with its assets 
carried at amortized cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk. Note 32 details how the Group determines whether there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk.
Impairment reviews
Goodwill and investments in associates and joint venture are tested for impairment at-least on an annual 
basis or when events that occur / changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of 
the CGU is less than its carrying value. In calculating the value in use, the Group is required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions inter-alia concerning the growth in EBITDA, long-term growth 
rates; discount rates to reflect the risks involved. Also, judgement is involved in determining the CGU for 
allocation of the goodwill.  For details about impairment reviews, refer note 36.
The Holding Company has investment in PPBL, an associate. During the year, given certain developments, 
the Company has recorded impairment of 100% carrying value. A qualitative assessment requires 
significant judgement (refer note 45)
Incentives
The Group provide incentives to users in various forms including cashbacks to promote its platform. 
Incentives to  users to whom the Group has a performance obligation is recorded as a reduction of 
revenue to the extent of the revenue earned. For the incentives to other transacting users to whom the 
Group has no performance obligation, management is required to determine whether the incentives are 
in substance a payment on behalf of the merchants and should therefore be recorded as a reduction of 
revenue or as marketing and promotional expenses. Some of the factors considered in management’s 
evaluation of such incentives being payments on behalf of  merchants include whether the incentives 
are given at the Group’s discretion, contractual agreements with the merchants, business strategy and 
objectives and design of the incentive program(s), etc.
Share-based payments
Employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share based payment instruments, whereby 
employees render services to group and receive equity instrument of Holding Company as consideration 
(equity-settled transactions). In accordance with the Ind AS 102 Share Based Payments, the cost of equity-
settled transactions is measured using the fair value method. The cumulative expense recognized for equity-
settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and the company's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.

Employees who are in continuous service for a period of 5 years are eligible for gratuity. The 
amount of gratuity payable on retirement/termination is the employees last drawn basic salary per 
month computed proportionately for 15 days salary multiplied for the number of years of service 
upto a limit of INR 20 Lakhs. The gratuity plan of Holding Comapny is a funded plan and the Holding 
Company makes contributions to recognised fund/insurer in India. The Group does not fully fund 
the liability and maintains a target level of funding to be maintained over a period of time based on 
estimations of expected gratuity payments. Disclosures given below are as per actuarial valuation 
report of independent actuary.

A quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant assumption as at March 31, 2023 is 
as shown below:
	
The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates 
the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions 
occurring at the end of the reporting period. The methods and types of assumptions used in 
preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior year.
	
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the period ending March 31, 
2025 are INR 1064 (March 31, 2024 - INR 254).
	
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 4 years (March 31, 
2023- 2.79 years). 
	
The average remaining working life of members of the defined benefit obligation as at March 
31, 2024 is 30.67 years (as at March 31, 2023- 30.87 years)
	
The expected maturity analysis of  gratuity is as follows:

Risk exposure
	
Through its defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant 
of which are detailed below:
	
Asset volatility: The plan assets are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to 
bond yields. If plan assets underperform this yield, there will be a deficit of the plan asset 
investments in fixed income securities with high grades and in government securities. These 
are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk to an acceptable level.
	
Changes in bond yields: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based 
on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
	
Inflation risks: The payments are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.

Life expectancy: Obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in 
life expectancy and inflation will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. This is particularly 
significant where inflationary conditions result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.

32. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk 
and liquidity risk. The Group continues to focus on a system-based approach to business risk 
management. The Group’s financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, 
evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business. Backed by strong internal 
control systems, the current Risk Management Framework rests on policies and procedures issued 
by appropriate authorities; process of regular internal reviews/audits to set appropriate risk limits 
and controls; monitoring of such risks and compliance confirmation for the same. 
a.	 Market Risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will 
fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market prices comprise three types of risk: 
interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and price risk. The Group has in place appropriate risk 
management policies to limit the impact of these risks on its financial performance. The Group 
ensures optimization of cash through fund planning and robust cash management practices.
	
(i)	 Interest Rate Risk
	
	
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial 
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
	
	
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the 
Group’s borrowings with floating interest rates.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
32. Financial risk management objectives and policies (Contd..)
	
	
There is no interest rate risk as the Group did not have borrowings at the end of the 
current financial year. The interest rate risk as at end of financial year is not material and 
thus not disclosed
	
	
Other financial assets and liabilities of the Group are either non-interest bearing or 
fixed interest bearing instruments, the Group’s net exposure to interest risk on such 
instruments is negligible.
	
(ii)	 Price risk
	
	
The Group invests its surplus funds in debt based mutual fund, fixed deposits, Commercial 
papers, Treasury bills, Government Securities, Certificate of deposits and non-convertible 
debentures. As on March 31, 2024, mutual fund investments were in debt based funds only.
	
	
Mutual fund investments are susceptible to market price risk, mainly arising from 
changes in the interest rates or market yields which may impact the return and value of 
such investments.
	
	
Set out below is the impact of a 0.25% movement in the NAV of mutual funds and debt 
instruments on the Group’s loss before tax:

March 31, 2023

The Group is also exposed to equity/ preference shares price risk arising from investments 
held by the Group and classified in the balance sheet either as fair value through OCI 
or at fair value through profit or loss (refer note 6(a) and 6(b)). To manage its price risk 
arising from investments in equity/preference shares, the Group diversifies its portfolio. 
Diversification of the portfolio is done in accordance with the limits set by the Group.
	
(iii)	Foreign currency risk
	
	
The Indian Rupee is the Group’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the Group’s 
results are presented in Indian Rupee and exposures are managed against Indian Rupee 
accordingly. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of 
an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s 
exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s 
operating activities and investing activities (when revenue, expense and Property, Plant 
and Equipment is denominated in a foreign currency).

The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity of profit or loss to a reasonably possible 
change in USD exchange rates, with all other variables held constant. The Group’s exposure 
to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

lying foreign currency against the functional currency while assuming all other variables 
to be constant.
	
	
Based on the movements in the foreign exchange rates historically and the prevailing 
market conditions as at the reporting date, the Group’s management has concluded that 
the above mentioned rates used for sensitivity are reasonable benchmarks.
	
	
*Amount below rounding off norms adopted by the Group
b.	 Credit Risk
	
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument 
or contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating 
activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its investing activities, including deposits with 
banks. Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored 
on an ongoing basis. The Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model on financial assets 
measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank 
balance. Cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirement of Ind AS 
109, the identified impairment loss was immaterial.
	
All of the Group investments and loans at amortised cost are considered to have low credit 
risk, and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 months 
expected losses. Management considers instruments to be low credit risk when they have 
a low risk of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow 
obligations in the near term.

(i)	 Trade receivables
	
	
The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers. Customer 
credit risk is managed subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control 
relating to customer credit risk management. An impairment analysis is performed at each 
reporting date by grouping the receivables in homogeneous group. The calculation is based 
on lifetime expected credit losses.

(ii)	 Other investments (excluding loans to related parties)
	
	
All of the Group’s other investments (preference shares, government securities, commercial 
papers, treasury bills and security deposits) at amortised cost are considered to have low 
credit risk, and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 
months’ expected losses. Management consider ‘low credit risk’ for listed instruments to be 
an investment grade credit rating with at least one major rating agency. Other instruments 
are considered to have low credit risk when they have a low risk of default and the issuer 
has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.
	
(iii)	Loan to related parties
	
	
The group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of loan and whether 
there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each 
reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the group 
compares the risk of a default occurring on the loan as at the reporting date with the risk of 
default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and supportive 
forwarding-looking information.
	
(iv)	Other financial assets
	
	
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s 
treasury department in accordance with the Group’s policy. Investment of surplus funds is 
made only with banks of high repute.
	
	
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet 
at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is the carrying amounts as illustrated in Note 
6 (c) and 6 (d).

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility 
through the use of bank overdrafts, working capital loans etc. Group monitor their risk of 
shortage of funds using cash flow forecasting models. These models consider the maturity of 
their financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations.

The Group’s objectives while managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going 
concern and to generate adequate returns for its shareholders and ensuring benefits for other 
stakeholders. The key objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains 
a stable capital structure with the focus on total equity, uphold investor; creditor and customer 
confidence, and ensure future development of its business activities. The Group manages its 
capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions or its 
business requirements.

achieves break-even. In order to meet this objective, Group meets anticipated funding requirements 
for developing new businesses, expanding its geographical base, entering in to strategic mergers 
and acquisitions and other strategic investments, by issuance of equity capital together with cash 
generated from Group’s operating and investing activities. The Group utilizes certain working 
capital facilities in the form of short term bank overdraft to meet anticipated interim working 
capital requirements.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the 
year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.

34. Segment Reporting
The Group is engaged in different business units, including payment and financial services and 
marketing services and the Board of Directors (Chief Operating Decision Maker “CODM”) reviews 
the information at the revenue level and does not allocate operating costs and expenses, assets and 
liabilities across business units, as the CODM does not use such information to allocate resources or 
evaluate the performance of the business units. Allocation of resources and assessment of financial 
performance is done at the consolidated level. The way the CODM reviews the performance, 
management of the Company has concluded that it constitutes a single segment as per Ind AS 108 
'Operating Segments'. Hence, no separate disclosure is required for segments.
The Group has revenues primarily from customers domiciled in India. Substantially all of the Group’s 
non-current operating assets are domiciled in India.
Information about major customers
Revenues of INR 8,264 are derived from one customer (March 31, 2023: INR 8,590 from one customer).

36. Impairment review
A.	 Goodwill arising on Consolidation
	
The Group monitors the business of the respective acquisitions independently and thus 
considers each acquisition as a separate Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’).
	
Carrying amount of Goodwill (net of impairment):-

The Group reviews the goodwill for any impairment at the CGU level. The recoverable amount of the 
above CGUs are based on value-in-use, which is determined based on five year business plans that 
have been approved by the management for internal purposes. The said planning horizon of five years 
reflects the assumptions for short to medium-term market developments. The cash flows beyond the 
planning period are extrapolated using appropriate terminal growth rates. The terminal growth rates 
used do not exceed the long term average growth rates of the respective industry and country in 
which the entity operates and are consistent with the internal/external sources of information.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations are as follows: 
 
 
Earnings before interest and taxes margins (‘EBIT’) 
 
 
Discount rate
 
 
Growth rates
	
EBIT margins: The margins have been estimated based on past experience after considering 
incremental revenue arising out of increase in payment business from the existing and new 
customers. Margins will be positively impacted from the efficiencies and initiatives driven by the 
Group; whereas, factors like increased cost of operations may impact the margins negatively.
	
Discount rate: Discount rate reflects the current market assessment of the risks specific to 
the CGU estimated based on the weighted average cost of capital. Pre-tax discount rate used 
ranged from 18% to 21% (March 31, 2023: 20% to 25%) which in the opinion of management are 
consistent with companies in similar business.
	
Growth rates: The terminal growth rates used are in the opinion of management in line with the 
long-term average growth rates of the respective industry in which the entity operates and are 
consistent with the internal/external sources of information. The terminal growth rates used in 
extrapolating cash flows beyond the planning period, range from 1.5 to 2.5 times (March 31, 
2023: 1.5 to 2.5 times) of revenue for the terminal year.
	
Goodwill Impairment
	
As at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the estimated recoverable amount of CGU exceeded 
its carrying amount and accordingly, no impairment was recognised. An analysis of the 
sensitivity of the computation to change in key assumptions based on reasonable probability 
did not identify any possible scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would 
decrease below its carrying amount.
B.	 Investment in Associate
	
For impairment testing, the management has treated investment in PPBL as a separate CGU 
and there is no change in the composition of this CGU since previous estimate of its recoverable 
amount. The impairment loss pertains to single segment as identified in note 34.
	
Considering the factors stated in note 45, the Holding Company has determined, on a prudent 
basis, that both the value-in-use and fair value less cost of disposal of the Holding Company’s 
investment in PPBL are nil at the reporting date. Since the management has used qualitative 
factors to determine value-in-use as well as fair value less cost of disposal of the Holding 
Company’s investment in PPBL, separate disclosures such as fair value hierarchy, valuation 
technique and assumptions used including discount rate are not separately given.

aggregating to INR 7. Based on response from AD Bank/RBI, these companies have obtained the 
STPI registration and are in the process of filing their respective applications for condonation of 
delays in respect of reporting of export of software and submission of SOFTEX forms with the 
STPI authorities.
The Group believes that there is no material financial impact of the above matters.
40. Transfer pricing
The Group has established a comprehensive system of maintenance of information and documents 
as required by the transfer pricing legislation under sections 92-92F of the Income Tax Act, 1961/
applicable regulations. For this purpose, the Group has appointed independent consultants for 
conducting Transfer Pricing Study. Management is of the opinion that its international transactions 
with associated enterprises have been undertaken at arms' length basis at duly negotiated prices 
on usual commercial terms. The transfer pricing study of the Holding Company for the year ended 
March 31, 2023 has been completed which did not result in any material adjustment.

Company has spent an amount of INR 8 (March 31, 2023: INR 26) as CSR expenditure.

42. Notes given by the subsidiary in respective Financial Statements/
Information:
Paytm Payments Services Limited:
The Company filed an application for authorization to set up Payment System (‘PA application’) 
under sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 with the 
Department of Payment and Settlement Systems, Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) on January 8, 
2021, in response to which, the Company received a letter from the RBI on November 25, 2022. 
As per the letter, the Company was required to obtain necessary approval for past downward 
investment from its parent company, One 97 Communications Limited ("OCL"), in compliance with 
Foreign Direct Investment (“FDI”) Guidelines and resubmit the PA application within 120 calendar 
days. Pursuant to the aforesaid, the Company had applied to the requisite government authorities 
seeking approval for the past downward investment made by OCL on December 14, 2022, which 
is still under process.
Further, the Company has received an extension of time from RBI, vide its letter dated March 23, 
2023, for resubmission of the application. As per RBI's letter, the Company can continue with the 
online payment aggregation business, while it awaits approval from Government of India (‘GoI’) for 
past downward investment from OCL into the Company and needs to resubmit the PA application 
within 15 days of receipt of the approval from GoI and to inform RBI immediately, if any adverse 
decision is taken by the GoI.
Management has assessed that this does not have a material impact on the financial statements 
and the business and revenues since the communication from RBI is applicable only to onboarding 
of new merchants. Accordingly, no adjustment has been made in these financial statements.
43. Utilisation of IPO proceeds
During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Holding Company had completed its initial public offer 
(IPO) of 85,116,278 equity shares of face value of INR 1 each at an issue price of INR 2,150 per 
share, comprising fresh issue of 38,604,651 shares and offer for sale of 46,511,627 shares by 
selling shareholders. Pursuant to the IPO, the equity shares of the Holding Company were listed

45. On January 31, 2024, the RBI issued a Press Release for action against Paytm Payments Bank 
Ltd (‘PPBL’), a 49% associate of the Company, under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 
1949, effectively restricting PPBL’s normal business, permitting only withdrawal of the existing 
customer balances.
Pursuant to the RBI’s actions as stated above, the Company has terminated its Nodal Accounts 
being maintained with PPBL. Subsequently, the Company has discontinued all major business 
activities it had with PPBL. Further, the Company has also made amendment to the shareholders 
agreement with PPBL by simplifying the terms therein and has also withdrawn its nominee director 
from the board of PPBL.
The business of PPBL has been significantly impacted by the RBI action described above. As of 
date, the audited financial statements of PPBL are not available and, accordingly, the Company 
has accounted for its share of losses and OCI of PPBL, based on unaudited financial information of 
PPBL as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024. 
As at March 31, 2024, the Company has investments in PPBL amounting to INR 2,271 after 
considering its share of loss of INR 276 and share of other comprehensive gain of INR 31, for the 
year ended March 31, 2024, on the basis of unaudited financial information.
The Company understand that there are certain factors affecting ongoing operations of PPBL, 
including restrictions which affect normal operations of the primary products such as wallet and 
banking services etc as per regulatory action on Jan 31, 2024, as well as ongoing uncertainty on 
the timing and nature of restoration of any of the impacted services.
Considering the future uncertainties associated on the business operations of PPBL as mentioned 
above, including the uncertainty of any other regulatory developments, the scaled down business 
operations of PPBL, restrictions affecting normal operations of the primary products such as saving 
accounts, current accounts, wallet, as well as non-availability of audited financial information from 
PPBL, the management, on a prudent basis, has determined that the value of the Company’s 
investment in PPBL is impaired and, accordingly, has recorded an impairment provision of INR 2,271, 
representing the carrying value of its investment in PPBL and disclosed the same as Impairment of 
investment in associate.
46. The Company during the year ended March 31, 2022 granted 21,000,000 Employee Stock Options 
to Managing Director and CEO of the Holding Company which is subject to achievement of specified 
milestones. During the current year, the Holding Company has received a Show Cause Notice (“SCN”) 
from SEBI related to the above options regarding compliance with SEBI SBEB Regulations. The Holding 
Company has submitted its preliminary response and is in the process of seeking further information 
from SEBI in this regard. Based on an independent legal opinion obtained by the management, it 
believes that the Holding Company is compliant with the relevant regulations. Accordingly, there is no 
impact on the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.
