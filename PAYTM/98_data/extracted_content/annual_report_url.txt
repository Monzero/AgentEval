III.	 Other Information:
	
a)	 Reason of loss or inadequate profits:
	
	
The 
Company 
has 
invested 
in 
growing and strengthening the Paytm 
ecosystem through the acquisition 
and 
retention 
of 
consumers 
and 
merchants, providing them greater 
access to technology and financial 
services. In the quarter ended March 
2024, the average Monthly Transacting 
User (“MTU”) base reached 96 million, 
marking a 7% year-over-year increase. 
Additionally, the number of merchants 
paying 
for 
subscription 
payment 
devices rose to 10.7 million, up from 6.8 
million as of March 2023. The Company 
has made substantial investments in 
marketing and promotions, product 
and engineering talent, expanding the 
sales team, and providing devices and 
services to merchants.	
	
b)	 Steps taken or proposed to be taken 
for 
improvement 
and 
expected 
increase in productivity and profits in 
measurable terms: 
	
	
Focus on monetization along with control 
on costs has yielded strong results. For 
FY 2024, the EBITDA before ESOP cost 
was Rs 559 Cr as compared to Rs (176) 
Cr for FY 2023, while contribution margin 
improved from Rs 3,900 Cr to Rs 5,538 
Cr in the same period. While since then 
there were temporary disruptions in 
growth of revenue, and profitability due 
to RBI directive on our associate, Paytm 
Payments Bank Limited (‘’PPBL’’) on 
January 31, 2024, we have completed 
the transition of services from PPBL to 
other partners. This ensures that our 
existing customers and merchants will 
be able to use our services as before 
while also opening up more long-
term monetisation opportunities with 
the partner banks, given our strong 
customer and merchant engagement 
on the platform.
	
	
We are conducting a comprehensive 
review of our cost structure across 
all areas. We are creating a leaner 
organizational 
structure 
focused 
on 
enhancing 
performance 
and 
productivity. 
We 
will 
continue 
to 
enhance our merchant sales team 
and risk and compliance functions, 
Significant progress has been made in 
using AI to enhance cost efficiencies 
across our operations.

Letter to Shareholders
Dear Shareholders,
Last year has been one of the most significant learning experiences for us. We focused on generating 
free cash flow and delivered on that for the full year. We were also laser-focused on delivering profits 
after accounting for all costs, including ESOP costs, and we came very close to achieving that target. 
In the last quarter, we encountered regulatory action on our associate entity Paytm Payments 
Bank Limited (‘PPBL’), which presented significant challenges and provided us with many valuable 
lessons. I am very proud of our resilient Paytm team, who navigated this situation with courage, 
dedication and humility.
There are times when actions speak louder than words and results speak louder than plans. After 
resolving many of the challenges that we faced, we are now refocused on our path to deliver a 
long-term, sustainable and profitable business model. Our resilient and committed team will deliver 
on our mission to building for India. The focus on financial inclusion and digitizing the informal 
economy will bring long-term benefits to both the company and the country.
For me personally, this year has been centered on our core business, instilling a compliance-first 
approach in every team member, and striving to become a consistently free cash generating 
company. The Paytm team has identified significant savings through the use of AI and has expanded 
in areas where we see the future of technology heading.
I believe that AI will be as instrumental in advancing India as the mobile/smartphone revolution has 
been. Your company has always been a technology first company and will not only leverage AI-led 
cost savings but also build AI-first products that can help small merchants and micro-businesses 
harness the power of technology previously available only to large enterprises.
Helping and serving our nation is a privilege we do not take lightly. The entire Paytm team remains 
committed to delivering fully compliant, fully made-in-India innovations that bring millions of Indians 
the advantages of the formal financial system.
Thank you for your support and guidance.
Best,
Vijay Shekhar Sharma

Management Discussion and Analysis
Macroeconomic overview
Mobile payments in India have seen robust growth over the past decade, specially in the 
unorganised sector. We believe that there still remains ample scope to further deepen penetration, 
as consumers and businesses look to rapidly adopt affordable, secure and easy-to-use technology. 
With our world-class, technology-led, mobile-first payment and financial services, we strive to 
bring unserved and underserved Indian consumers and businesses to the mainstream economy. 
We enable merchants to accept a variety of payment options through our offerings such as QR 
codes, Soundboxes, EDC devices (card machines) and online payment gateway, and also help 
grow their businesses, by leveraging our app traffic and marketing services offerings. Consumers 
come to our app for the variety of payment use cases (such as P2P payments, merchant payments, 
mobile recharges, utility bills, etc) and the extensive range of payment options we offer.  
India continues to be one of the fastest growing economies globally and is estimated to attain 
8.2%(1) real GDP growth in FY24. The Reserve Bank of India has further raised India’s FY25 real GDP 
forecast to 7.2% from 7.0%(2), on prospects of improving rural and urban demand conditions. This 
puts India firmly on track to become a $7 trillion economy by 2030(3).
Industry overview and Outlook 
India’s payments landscape has benefitted from multiple developments over the past few years, 
be it innovations in mobile payments and digital infrastructure, continued regulatory support, or 
government initiatives to push for increased consumer and merchant acceptance. 
Given the increasing shift towards a cashless economy and user preference for transacting via their 
mobile phones, mobile payments continue to scale rapidly. This is further boosted by the growth 
of digital commerce and services. As a result, digital transactions in India have surpassed INR 3.2 
thousand lakh crore in FY 2023 and are expected to touch INR 4 thousand lakh crore by FY 2026.(4) 
Paytm is an integral part in the growth of mobile payments across the country. We offer a 
comprehensive suite of payment solutions to both consumers and merchants. This helps merchants 
expand their businesses using Paytm app traffic and also provides attractive cross-sell and up-
sell opportunities.

Management Discussion and Analysis

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 42
We believe that non-cash payments still remain under-penetrated in India, when compared to other 
countries. For instance, the value of card transactions (credit card + debit card) remains at c.8% of 
GDP in FY24. Including mobile payments such as UPI (P2M only), this ratio is c.25% (Source: RBI, 
NPCI) and is expected to grow multifold in the coming years.
The Indian Digital Lending market is expected to grow to $515 billion by 2030, growing at a 2021-
30E CAGR of 33%(5). The Indian WealthTech market will grow to $237 billion(5) by 2030 on the 
back of a growing base of retail investors, with the InsuranceTech market expected to reach $88 
billion(5) by 2030 driven by untapped opportunities and innovative models.
Our Business Model
Over the past year, in response to evolving industry landscape and regulations our business model 
has seen some changes, such as pausing small ticket credit (Paytm Postpaid), transition of UPI to 
multiple bank partners given the embargo on Paytm Payments Bank. This transition has helped de-
risk our business model and also opens up new opportunities for long-term monetization, given our 
platform’s strength around customer and merchant engagement. We continue to build a payment 
led ecosystem based on a comprehensive suite of payments services to consumers and merchants 
and leverage this ecosystem to distribute high margin financial services and marketing services.
Our payments business is an important customer and merchant acquisition tool for the platform. We 
enable merchants to accept a variety of payment options through our offerings such as QR codes, 
soundboxes, EDC devices and online payment gateway, and also help grow their businesses, by 
leveraging our app traffic and Marketing services offerings. Consumers come to our app for the 
variety of payment use cases (such as P2P payments, merchant payments, mobile recharges, utility 
bills, etc) as well as the comprehensiveness of available payment instruments. 
The large size of our ecosystem allows us to distribute high margin financial services such as 
credit, wealth management and insurance to our consumers and merchants. We also offer high 
margin Marketing Services use cases such as ticketing, gift vouchers, commerce to consumers and 
empower merchants to grow their business using services such as advertising and loyalty solutions.

deploying devices that help with reconciliations.
 
 
Small merchants can use QR codes, or use Soundbox devices which allow better reconciliation 
for merchants, hence enhancing their trust in mobile payments, and generating subscription 
revenues for us. The government also pays us incentive on certain types of transactions.
 
 
Our mid-sized and large retailers also use our POS devices which enables them to accept 
mobile and card payments, thus generating both MDR as well as subscription revenues for us.
 
 
For Online and Omni channel merchants we offer a robust payment gateway product, allowing 
merchants to reliably accept payments across all channels, which generates MDR revenue 
and platform fees.

Financial Services
Our Financial services offerings to consumers and merchants consist of innovative financial inclusion 
offerings like mobile credit, insurance, and wealth management for consumers and merchants.
Loan Distribution
As part of our loan distribution business, we operate a technology platform with capabilities across 
the entire loan lifecycle including origination, loan management and collection to provide credit 
access to our consumers and merchants through our financial institution partners. Our partners 
are able to work with Paytm to distribute products to customers who would have otherwise been 
harder to reach or service in a cost-effective manner. 
We distribute two types of loans (1) Loans where we also help the lenders with collection; (2) 
Distribution-only loans where our lending partner is responsible for the collections.
Our loan distribution business continues to scale providing attractive upsell revenues. Our lending 
partners disbursed loans of value H 52,390 Cr in FY 2024, a growth of 48% YoY from H 35,378 Cr in 
FY 2023. Out of the total disbursed loan value, H 25,264 Cr were disbursals from Postpaid loans, 
which have now been paused. 
Marketing Services 
To help our merchant partners grow their business by leveraging Paytm’s consumer traffic, we offer 
them marketing services like ability to sell tickets, deals and gift vouchers to customers. In addition, 
we also provide advertising, and loyalty services.
The distribution of co-branded credit cards also falls under our marketing services business. As 
of March 2024, we have a total of 1.2 million activated cards with SBI Card, HDFC Bank and Kotak 
Bank. We generate upfront revenue on card activation and receive a portion of the interchange fee

for the lifetime of the card. We see a strong runway for growth in this business, especially given the 
upsell potential to payments and loan distribution consumers.
Business Update and Outlook
In FY 2024, we achieved our first full year (since IPO) of EBITDA before ESOP profitability of H 
559 Cr, demonstrated strong revenue momentum (+25% YoY) and discipline around profitability 
(EBITDA margin up 8% YoY).
However, we were impacted by the RBI directive on our associate, Paytm Payment Bank Ltd (“PPBL”) 
in January 2024, which affected our scale of revenue and near-term profitability. With support from 
the Regulator, NPCI and our Bank partners, we have now successfully transitioned the services 
provided by PPBL to other partner banks which enables us to continue serving our customers and 
merchants uninterrupted. We believe this transition will further de-risk our business model and will 
open up more long-term monetisation opportunities with the partner banks, leveraging our strong 
customer and merchant engagement on the platform. 
Strong Revenue Momentum in FY 2024
We report our revenue under two lines, (i) Payment and Financial Services, and (ii) Marketing Services.

Payments business has two margin drivers - Payments 
processing margin and Subscriptions
In payment processing, we make a payment processing margin (i.e. revenues earned from processing 
payments less charges incurred on such transactions). We earn revenues on processing all kinds of 
payments, including those made with UPI (in the form of incentives from the government and MDR 
on payments made through Rupay Credit Card on UPI). 
Apart from earning revenues on processing payments, we also earn subscription revenue from 
merchants who use our payment devices, such as Soundbox and EDC machines. As of March 2024, 
our deployed payment devices increased to 107 lakh from 68 lakh in FY 2023, thus accelerating 
our subscription revenues. Merchants use our devices not only for accepting payments but also for 
fraud prevention and reconciliation services.

Net Payments Margin, defined as payments revenue (on payment processing as well as subscription 
revenue) less payment processing charges is a key indicator of profitability in this business. 
Payments profitability has improved over the years, with net payments margin growing 50% YoY to H 
2,955 Cr for FY 2024. Improvement in payment profitability is on account of increased monetization 
in the payments business as well as optimization of processing charges. 
Financial Services and Others
Financial Services and Others include revenues that we make from our financial services partners 
or consumers of our financial services offerings, primarily loan distribution. Revenue from financial 
services and others grew 30% to H 2,004 Cr in FY 2024 from H 1,540 Cr in FY 2023, primarily driven 
by 48% Y-o-Y growth in the value of loans processed in FY 2024 to H 52,390 Cr, from H 35,378 
Cr in FY 2023. We are also focusing on insurance broking and equity broking. In addition, we are 
expanding distribution of mutual funds where we see strong tailwinds in terms of participation of 
the retail investors in the equity markets.

investments primarily in technology, merchants sales and financial services. Our software, cloud and 
data center expenses have declined 7% YoY to H 643 Cr in FY 2024 from H 694 Cr in FY 2023 driven 
by optimisations in cloud costs. This is a result of our indigenously developed payments technology 
platform, which is upgraded with new-age technological solutions and equipped with faster speed 
and higher security. Other direct expenses grew 24% from H 485 Cr in FY 2023 to H 600 Cr in FY 2024, 
primarily due to increase in device refurbishment expenses and provisions for doubtful debt.
We are optimizing our cost structure, leveraging AI capabilities, and focusing on our core business 
will enable us to achieve significant cost efficiencies. This includes creating a leaner organization 
structure and pruning non-core businesses.
For the coming year, while we continue to invest in the merchant sales team, as well as risk and 
compliance functions, we expect reductions in other employee costs. We expect annualized people 
cost savings of H 400 - H 500 Cr.

Drivers for Growth and Opportunities
Our ecosystem allows us to address large and fast growing market opportunities: As India’s leading 
mobile ecosystem for consumers and merchants, we have built the largest payments ecosystem 
in terms of number of consumers and merchants. Customers use various payment services on 
our platform, and merchants use us to accept payments and grow their business. We also provide 
financial services through our financial institution partners, particularly loan distribution. Payments 
is a universal need for consumers and merchants, and provides us an attractive way of acquiring, 
retaining and monetising customers and merchants. It continues to give us very high engagement, 
and in addition, we believe we can make substantial revenues and profits in payments. Mobile 
distribution of credit is a massive and scalable profit pool in India. Our ecosystem allows us to 
address these multiple large and fast growing market opportunities at scale and gives us multiple 
growth vectors.
Our business model creates sustainable advantages for us: We believe that our brand, distribution, 
insights, technology skills, and the scope of our ecosystem give us an advantage to grow our 
business through, (i) cost-effective acquisition of consumers and merchants; (ii) reinforce our 
platform by building higher engagement and stickiness with consumers and merchants; and (iii) 
build high monetisation products at low cost of acquisition.
Our product and technology DNA: Our technology stack is built ground up and integrated across 
all aspects of our ecosystem. This allows us to integrate our payments offering seamlessly with 
other offerings. Similarly, for financial services, our technology infrastructure is built on a stack that 
is owned, controlled and written by us and our subsidiaries. Our technology ownership and scope 
of our ecosystem has allowed us (and and financial institution partners) to offer services such 
as Paytm QR, Paytm Soundbox, Gold investments, Personal Loans and Merchant Cash Advance. 
All of these products aim to improve the experience of consumers and merchants who use it 
in our ecosystem.
Enabling regulatory environment: In our view, the regulatory environment in India remains 
constructive and supportive of digital payments and financial services. RBI in its Payments Vision 
2025  has reinforced the themes of enabling growth of digital payments across multiple instruments 
including UPI and cards. Regulatory compliance remains a key focus for us as an organization. 
Internal Control Systems and Risk Management Framework
In a rapidly evolving business, technical and regulatory environment coupled with dynamic consumer 
demands and growing competition, our risk profile is also evolving constantly. Our Company is 
cognizant that effective risk management is core to a sustainable business. We have therefore 
adopted a dynamic risk management framework that functions under the oversight of our Audit 
Committee and Risk Management Committee.

Anti-money laundering and Counter-terrorism Financing Risk Management: To ensure clean 
day-to-day operations, we have instituted comprehensive on-boarding and risk management 
practices, which include appropriate anti-money laundering policies and procedures.
Investments and Acquisitions Risk Management: To ensure that our investments and acquisitions 
are strategically complementary to our business, we have an identified team of professionals who 
manage our portfolio in alignment with the Company’s growth plans.
Business and Operational Risks
Macro economic environment: We continue to monitor and adapt to any macro-economic condition 
that affects our customers and merchants as it could also have an impact on our business. We will 
continue to do all that is necessary and in our control in such scenarios. 
Financial: We continue to focus on improving profitability while making disciplined investments in 
areas such as expanding our products and services, broadening our marketing and promotional 
activities to acquire and retain customers and merchants. There could be growth in expenses as 
we continue to expand our business operations. 
Pace of technology innovation: We make significant investments to constantly improve the 
scale, stability and functionality of our technology. Failure to maintain best-in-class technology 
infrastructure could harm our business and prospects.
Cybersecurity: Our platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for business continuity and 
to manage cybersecurity risks and data security breaches. We use analytics and machine learning 
to ensure optimum automated fraud detection during transaction processing. Encrypted data 
transmission using security protocols and algorithms ensures confidentiality and prevents leakage 
of confidential customer data. Data and technology infrastructures are vulnerable to cyber attacks, 
as any such incident could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business. 
Regulatory: We are extremely focused on ensuring compliance with the statutory and regulatory 
framework, and are continuously strengthening our compliance processes and management depth 
as some of our businesses are subject to a fast evolving regulatory landscape. 
Competition: We consistently invest in enhancing our platform and customer-centric services 
in order to maintain our leadership. Our industry is extremely competitive, and consumers and 
merchants have multiple options. 
Litigation: We have a dedicated team to manage litigation risk and engage external consultants where 
necessary, thereby ensuring minimum impact of materiality. As a Company (or key management) 
we may be subject to legal proceedings, including ongoing litigation in tax, civil or other matters.

Sustainability and Supporting our Community 
We are governed by our values of serving the community, and maintaining trust while moving fast, 
responsibly and focusing on the underserved and unserved. Not only do we solve for our merchants 
receiving mobile payments via various sources, and in turn, engaging more users, but also provide 
seamless and safe access to micro-credit, business payment solutions and wealth management.
Paytm is committed to sustainability and is dedicated to ESG. The company’s sustainability efforts 
include reducing its carbon footprint, promoting financial inclusion, and supporting local communities.
Mobile Payments: Paytm has played a significant role in promoting mobile payments and reducing 
the reliance on cash transactions. By providing a seamless and secure digital payment experience, 
Paytm has contributed to greater financial inclusion and transparency, reducing the environmental 
impact associated with the production and circulation of physical currency. Products like Soundbox 
devices allow better reconciliation for merchants, hence enhancing their trust in digital payments.
Financial Inclusion: Paytm has been instrumental in promoting financial inclusion by providing 
access to financial services to individuals who were previously unserved. Through its services, 
Paytm has enabled people to send, and receive money digitally, empowering them economically 
and reducing inequalities.
Paytm’s commitment to ESG principles goes beyond its business operations. The company actively 
engages in social and environmental initiatives to drive positive change. It supports various social 
causes, including education, healthcare, and disaster relief. 
Engaging Users on Social Causes
As one of India’s largest digital platforms, we take pride in being able to mobilize our ecosystem 
participants in times of social and disaster relief. During the year we have continued to raise social 
awareness and raise contributions from our users to aid the Central and State governments, as

well as independent local bodies, by enabling online payments to their preferred non-governmental 
organization or any other platform.
International forums for Sustainability
We proudly represent our country on international forums working for sustainability. Since December 
2017, our Founder, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, has been the United Nations Environment Programme’s 
(“UNEP”) Advocate for Clean Air, and helps drive greater environmental action and awareness to 
advocate for UNEP’s global #BreatheLife campaign – a major initiative on air quality seeking to 
influence policy and citizen action for a healthy future.
Our Founder is also on the Advisory Board of the Green Digital Finance Alliance. The Alliance was 
set up to address the potential for digital finance and fintech-powered business innovations to 
reshape the financial system in ways that better align it with the needs of sustainable development.
Laptop Donation - Shikshit Bharat
"Shikshit Bharat" an initiative started to promote education and support the overall development 
of underprivileged children in India. The initiative aims to provide access to quality education, 
infrastructure, and resources to children from economically weaker sections of society. The focus 
of the initiative is on building and establishing computer labs, and other educational facilities like 
e-libraries to create a conducive learning environment for students.
Paytm Foundation donated laptops and desktops and created an impact in the lives of more than 
7,500 students. These digital equipment were used to equip children with essential life skills and 
vocational training, empowering them for better opportunities in the future. Encouraged by the 
success of this initiative, we have plans to further expand this initiative, which aims to bridge the 
digital divide faced in the country. 
Creating Awareness of Digital Financial Platforms 
Through our partnerships with Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) for training programs, we have 
successfully trained over 5,000 officials so far. The programs are designed to help Investigation 
agencies, such as state police, cyber cell, and CID, to understand the overall financial ecosystem, 
covering topics like payments processing, typical frauds in cyber crime domain. We also inform them 
about safety measures we have built to prevent fraud on our platform. So far we have conducted 
over 100 sessions across more than 20 states in the country.

with the Audited Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year ended

State of Affairs of the Company / 
Operational Highlights
Your Company continued expansion of its 
payments and financial services businesses 
during FY 2023-24. Our payments business 
is 
our 
acquisition 
engine 
which 
brings 
customers to our platform. We monetize these 
customers by cross selling various financial & 
marketing services. 
As a result of the Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) direction to Paytm Payments Bank 
Limited (“PPBL”) our associate Company, on 
January 31, 2024, Paytm has become a Third-
Party Application Provider (“TPAP”) for the UPI 
channel, partnering with Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, 
State Bank of India and YES Bank. The Company 
has transitioned users of the @paytm handle to 
new bank handles—@pthdfc, @ptaxis, @ptsbi, 
or @ptyes—ensuring seamless UPI payments. 
We have now partnered with various banks for 
existing and new UPI customers and merchants, 
card acquiring and Bank Identification Number 
sponsorship for card acceptance offering 
to merchants, nodal/escrow accounts for 
merchant fund settlement, FasTag distribution 
and BBPS. This will open up more long-term 
monetisation opportunities with the partner 
banks, given our strong customer and merchant 
engagement on the platform.
Key aspects of our Company’s consolidated 
performance during FY 2023-24 are as follows: 
 
 
The Company achieved its first full year of 
operating profitability, with EBITDA before 
ESOP of H 559 Cr (including UPI Incentives), 
driven by 25% YoY revenue growth and 
expansion of contribution margin. With 
recent disruptions, there has been a steady 
state annualised EBITDA impact of around 
H 500 Cr owing to discontinuation of PPBL 
offerings such as wallet and FasTag. Our 
average monthly transacting users for the 
quarter ended March 2024 were 9.6 Cr, up 
by 7% YoY from 9.0 Cr; driven by variety of 
use cases that we offer, as mobile payments 
adoption for consumers and merchants in 
India continues to grow.
 
 
Subscription services for payment devices, 
such as Soundbox and POS machines, 
is also witnessing strong adoption, with 
1.07 Cr merchants paying us subscriptions 
as of March 2024, a significant increase from  
68 lakhs as of March 2023.
 
 
Our loan distribution business, in partnership 
with our lending partners, continues to 
scale with loans amounting to H 52,390 Cr, 
a YoY growth of 48%.
 
 
Gross merchandise volume of payments 
facilitated through our platform for the year 
ended March 31, 2024 has grown 38% YoY 
to H 18.34 Lakh Cr from H 13.22 Lakh Cr for 
the year ended March 31, 2023. 
The growth of UPI and other mobile payment 
methods presents a wealth of untapped 
opportunities. In March 2024, we received 
approval from National Payments Corporation 
of India (NPCI) to participate in UPI as a TPAP 
under 
multi-bank 
model. 
Our 
pioneering 
innovation, 
Paytm 
Soundbox, 
has 
been 
groundbreaking for our merchants. Our device 
has seen a rapid adoption across the country 
and played a vital role in empowering small 
and micro-businesses in India. It supports 
11 languages including English and Regional 
Languages. In order to serve the diverse needs 
of our growing merchant base, we continue to 
launch innovative products, like Card Soundbox

(enabling merchants to accept mobile and card 
payments), Pocket Soundbox (a small card-
sized device which easily fits in the pocket and 
is helpful for merchants on the go, including 
auto drivers, delivery agents, parking fee 
collectors etc.) and Music Soundbox (allowing 
merchants to listen to music over Bluetooth 
speaker, improving their engagement).
During this period, as disclosed on March 1, 2024, 
Paytm and PPBL undertook additional measures 
to pursue independent future plans and mutually 
agreed to discontinue various inter-company 
agreements with Paytm and its group entities. 
Also, the shareholders of PPBL have agreed 
to simplify the Shareholders Agreement to 
support PPBL’s governance. Further, PPBL has 
reconstituted its Board of Directors to be fully 
independent, with the appointment of various 
Independent Directors and a new Chairman. 
Paytm supports the direction of independent 
future plans for PPBL and has accordingly 
withdrawn its nominee from PPBL’s Board of 
Directors. Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma has also 
resigned from the Board of Directors of PPBL to 
enable this transition.

Conservation of Energy and 
Technology Absorption 
Energy Conservation:
The Company’s operations are not energy 
intensive. 
However, 
the 
Company 
has 
implemented 
various 
energy 
conservation 
measures, such as adopting good practices in 
all major offices for energy conservation like 
the use of LED lights, ban on one-time use 
plastic, energy-efficient appliances, sensor-
based water faucets and sensor-based lighting 
systems in toilets.
The corporate office building of the Company 
is an Indian Green Building Council Platinum 
certified building and is primarily focused on 
developing sustainable sites, increased water 
and energy efficiency, reduced waste and 
emissions, use of eco-friendly building materials, 
and improving indoor environmental quality 
more efficiently than conventional designs like 
energy-efficient windows, LED lighting, energy-
efficient appliances, geothermal heat pumps, 
and energy efficient insulation. 
Further, in most of our facilities, VRV/VRF air-
conditioned systems are installed that are 
second generation energy efficient products. 
We have also installed VAV controllers in all 
meeting rooms & floors to maintain the required 
cooling as per floor occupancy, which ultimately 
reduces the overall load of the air handling 
unit and chiller. Heat resistant facade glasses 
have been installed all across the building that 
restricts the heat & maintains the temperature on 
the floor, which also facilitates the natural light 
throughout the day. All electrical appliances that 
we are sourcing for the office are 5* (star) rated 
for higher energy efficiency. We have a BMS 
(Building Management System) for controlling 
and monitoring energy conservation.
The other conservation measures undertaken by 
the Company during FY 2023-24 are mentioned 
in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report, which forms part of the Annual Report.

Share Transfer System
During FY 2023-24, the RTA of the Company ensured compliance with all the procedural 
requirements with respect to transfer, transmission and transposition of shares and formalities 
with respect to name deletion, sub-division, consolidation, renewal, exchange and endorsement of 
share certificates.
SEBI vide its Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/POD-1/P/CIR/2024/37 dated May 07, 2024 read 
with other applicable circulars, from time to time, if any, mandated all the listed companies to issue 
securities in dematerialised form only, while processing the service request for issue of duplicate 
securities certificates, renewal/exchange of securities certificate, claim from Unclaimed Suspense 
Account, endorsement, sub-division/ splitting of securities certificate, consolidation of securities 
certificates/folios, transmission and transposition. Accordingly, the Company / its RTA are not 
accepting any lodgement of transfer of shares in physical form. Members holding shares in physical 
form are advised to avail the facility of dematerialisation. However, investors are not barred from 
holding shares in physical form. Transfers in electronic form are much simpler and quicker as the 
members have to approach their respective depository participants and the transfers are processed 
by NSDL/ CDSL, as the case may be, with no requirement of any separate communication to be 
made to the Company.
Shareholders holding more than 1% of the shares as on March 31, 2024
The details of top shareholders holding more than 1% (PAN-based) of the equity as on March 31,

capital of the Company as on March 31, 2024.

conversion date and likely impact on 
equity
The Company has not issued any GDRs / ADRs 
/ Warrants or any convertible instruments in

ADRs / Warrants or any convertible instruments.
Commodity price risk or foreign 
exchange risk and hedging 
activities:
Commodity Risk:
The Company is not exposed to any commodity 
price risk, and hence the disclosure under 
Clause 9(n) of Part C of Schedule V in terms of 
the format prescribed vide SEBI Master Circular 
dated July 11, 2023, is not applicable.
Foreign Exchange Risk:
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair 
value of future cash flows of an exposure 
will fluctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to 
the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates 
relates primarily to the Company’s operating and 
investing activities (when revenue or expense/
capex is denominated in a foreign currency).
The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange 
rates may have potential impact on the 
statement of profit and loss where assets / 
liabilities are denominated in a currency other 
than the functional currency of the Company.
During FY 2023-24, the Company did not 
undertake any derivative hedging activity and 
managed its foreign exchange risk through a 
mix of close monitoring, management review 
and natural hedge.
Plant Locations

the ESG Committee presents its findings to the CSR Committee, which in turn offers necessary 
recommendations to the Board and management on pertinent matters.
The responsibilities of the ESG Committee encompass a range of tasks, including approving, 
noting, and ratifying ESG goals, targets, and strategies. Additionally, they consult on ESG 
related stakeholder matters, monitor performance, oversee the execution of ESG initiatives, and 
ensure alignment with long-term ESG commitments and targets. Encompassing various ESG 
dimensions such as energy, water, waste, human rights, and supply chain, the ESG Committee 
also oversees material ESG risks and opportunities, actively seeking to mitigate risks while 
considering their financial implications.

Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the 
inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities 
of the entity.  
Yes, in the fiscal year 2023-24, guided by stakeholder consultations, we have begun 
implementing new policies developed in alignment with material topics and NGRBC principles. 
Furthermore, we have established an ESG committee and conducted financial inclusion 
sessions for women, along with a health and safety session for vendors.
We rely on internal stakeholder consultation for the identification and management of environmental 
and social topics. Additionally, to align our material topics with our business strategy and bring 
independence, we engaged an external consultant during the financial year, to gain comprehensive 
insights into emerging trends and best practices. In alignment with the sectoral guidance of leading 
ESG frameworks and indices, relevant material topics were identified and further refined.

The insights garnered from both internal consultations and external assessments have helped 
us craft our ESG strategy, in line with identified topics. New policies developed in alignment 
with the identified material topics and NGRBC principles are currently in the implementation 
phase. These identified topics shall serve as the foundation around which our strategy is built, 
and throughout the year, our ESG activities, targets and performance metrics across various 
departments will be developed accordingly.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.  
We recognize the importance of giving back to society, and our company actively engages 
on various aspects of social and community development across India, in collaboration with 
numerous nonprofits to address the concerns of vulnerable/marginalized stakeholder groups. 
Aligned with our ‘CSR policy,’ which outlines the process of execution, utilization, monitoring, 
among others, our company focuses on addressing the concerns of these stakeholder groups. 
We continuously identify opportunities to improve the lives of the disadvantaged, vulnerable, 
and marginalized stakeholders through our ongoing CSR engagements.
Through one of our flagship educational CSR initiatives, Shikshit Bharat, we aim to bridge 
the digital gap between rural and urban areas, leveraging the pivotal role of technology in 
fostering equitable development. Via this program, we have distributed 186 laptops and 33 
desktops to schools, nonprofits, and government bodies, primarily targeting the women in rural 
areas, providing digital tools to overcome educational, employment, and economic barriers, 
empowering them towards independence. Also, in collaboration with the Scaler Foundation, 
Paytm extended a scholarship to 24 underprivileged engineering students in Bangalore, aiming 
to support their higher education.
We also conducted comprehensive financial literacy sessions as part of our volunteering 
activities. These sessions have reached over 1000 women representing diverse organizations, 
delving into fundamental principles of finance management. By equipping participants with 
essential knowledge and skills, we empower them to navigate the intricacies of finance with 
confidence. Moreover, our employee volunteering efforts encompass 179 volunteers dedicating 
their time, benefiting a total of 5001 individuals, and accumulating a remarkable total of 1342 
volunteering hours.

allowing employees to directly raise grievances through the HRMS platform. 
Aligned with the whistle-blower mechanism, stakeholders are expected to report concerns 
such as bribery, corruption suspicions, behavioral issues, or discrimination. Confidentiality 
of complainants is upheld, with reporting facilitated through the web portal "Navex Global." 
Detailed instructions for reporting are available on the intranet and in the ABAC Policy on the 
Company's website.
Each complaint submitted through the Navex portal receives a unique case number for tracking 
purposes. Timely investigations are conducted, ensuring regulatory compliance. Following 
investigation completion, a report with recommended actions is submitted to relevant 
stakeholders, including the Disciplinary Action Committee, guided by the Consequence 
Management Policy. This policy ensures protection against retaliation for complainants raising 
concerns in good faith, regardless of their ultimate substantiation.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and 
harassment cases. 
As mentioned in our Code of Conduct, the Company and all its affiliate Companies shall 
provide equal opportunities to all its employees/Personnel and all qualified applicants for 
employment without regard to their race, caste, religion, colour, ancestry, marital status, work 
experience, gender, sexual orientation, age, nationality, ethnic origin or disability. We have 
adopted policies which reinforce to the stakeholders, who raise complaints on a concrete and 
reasonable belief about a violation, that they will not be subjected to any kind of retaliation 
such as discrimination, reprisal, harassment, victimization etc. irrespective of the concern 
being ultimately substantiated. 
The Company has zero tolerance for any kind of harassment and discrimination. Our Human 
Resource policies and Code of Conduct promote diversity and equality in the workplace, as 
well as compliance with all local labour laws, while encouraging the adoption of international 
best practices.
Employee policies and practices are administered in a manner consistent with applicable laws 
and other provisions of the Code of Conduct, respect for the right to privacy and the right to 
be heard, and that in all matters equal opportunity is provided to those eligible and decisions 
are based on merit.
In addition, the POSH Policy has been formed under the provisions of the Sexual Harassment of 
Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, to prohibit, prevent or 
deter the commission of acts of sexual harassment at workplace and to provide the procedure 
for the redressal of complaints pertaining to sexual harassment. In case any allegations of sexual 
harassment are substantiated by the ICC, appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken against 
the accused. Disciplinary action may include transfer, withholding promotion, suspension or 
even dismissal. This action shall be in addition to any legal recourse sought by the complainant. 
The Company also has a whistle blower mechanism that empowers its employees to raise 
the concerns, if any, for instances like bribery, suspicion of corruption, behavioral issues, 
discrimination etc. via this vigil mechanism. Complaints reported to any internal stakeholder 
(reporting manager/ HR team/ Compliance Officer) of any potential violation are channelized 
to the whistle blowing mechanism. The identity of the complainants is kept confidential during 
the investigation. The Company has enabled the web portal “Navex Global” to take anonymous 
complaints and facilitate reporting of the protected disclosures routed through the web links, 
toll-free number and application access mentioned in detail on the Intranet, Deep Purple. The 
Company investigates all the complaints reported under the whistle blowing mechanism after 
the due approval from a member of the Disciplinary Action Committee in a timely manner. The 
investigating team ensures compliance with all the regulatory requirements during the course of 
investigation. After the completion of the investigation, a report is submitted with recommended 
measures to the Disciplinary Action Committee. The Disciplinary Action Committee initiates

We are proud to represent our nation on the global stage, actively advocating for sustainable 
practices. Since December 2017, our Founder & CEO, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, has been serving 
as the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) advocate  for Clean Air. He has been 
instrumental in driving environmental action and awareness, championing UNEP’s global 
#BreatheLife campaign, which focuses on improving air quality and influencing policy and 
citizen action for a healthier future.
In collaboration with UNEP, our CSR arm, Paytm Foundation, launched the Air Quality Action 
Forum (AQAF) last financial year. This national-level forum brings together regulators, national 
and international philanthropic organisations, international development agencies, and 
the corporate sector. The goal is to identify needs, gaps, and solutions to India’s air quality 
problems, ensuring structured project implementation with a yearly action plan. AQAF facilitates 
an inclusive approach to tackling air pollution through stakeholder engagement.
Vijay also serves on the Advisory Board of the Green Digital Finance Alliance. This Alliance 
explores the potential for digital finance and fintech innovations to reshape the financial system 
in alignment with sustainable development goals. Our initiatives, such as reducing paper 
usage by promoting digital transactions and e-receipts, reflect our commitment to conserving 
resources and reducing pollution.
Paytm’s ‘Box of Joy’ initiative epitomises purposeful gifting with environmental consciousness 
and community engagement. Central to this initiative is the ‘Vriksharopan’ project, where Paytm 
pledges to plant two trees for each employee in the newly established Paytm Forest near the 
National Capital Region (NCR), in collaboration with the Sankalptaru Foundation. This afforestation 
effort addresses environmental concerns and contributes to socio-economic empowerment by 
providing livelihood opportunities to local communities responsible for nurturing these trees.
Each tree planted under the ‘Box of Joy’ initiative is geotagged, allowing employees to monitor 
their growth and visit the site. This deepens their connection with nature and reinforces 
Paytm’s dedication to community welfare and environmental sustainability. This comprehensive 
approach exemplifies how Paytm seamlessly integrates joy, environmental stewardship, and 
social responsibility into its operational framework.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
The Company's operations do not involve the use of hazardous or toxic chemicals. In managing 
electronic waste (e-waste) responsibly, the Company has implemented comprehensive 
systems across all its facilities in India. Our dedication to environmental stewardship extends 
to the handling of e-waste assets, which undergo a structured disposal process. We strictly 
adhere to our comprehensive E-Waste Policy, ensuring the proper management of e-waste 
resulting from our business operations. To uphold these standards, we collaborate with e-waste 
vendors approved by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), guaranteeing responsible 
and compliant e-waste handling practices across our operations.
The Company has also devised a comprehensive waste collection strategy in accordance with 
the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to the CPCB. To efficiently manage 
other forms of waste, the Company segregates and stores generated waste into two distinct 
categories: dry waste and wet waste, utilizing appropriate bins for this purpose. All waste 
generated on our premises is managed through our partnerships with government-authorized 
agencies equipped with sorting and processing facilities.

or criminal activities that could disrupt business operations and escalate into emergency 
situations. This plan outlines the specific procedures to be enacted during such occurrences.
	
The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) documentation encompasses the following 
key components:
 
 
Establishment of an Emergency Response Team (ERT): Comprising individuals trained to 
prepare for and respond to emergency incidents, the ERT addresses a wide spectrum 
of potential crises, including natural disasters and industrial accidents. Through ongoing 
training and awareness-building exercises, the ERT enhances preparedness and 
response capabilities.
 
 
Deployment of a Quick Response Team (QRT): Operating round-the-clock as the initial 
responders, the QRT comprises a designated driver and two Civil Defence Volunteers 
skilled in firefighting, search and rescue, and first aid. During emergencies such as 
fires, the Emergency Coordinator assumes primary responsibility for coordinating 
staff response efforts and liaising with external emergency services. Additionally, the 
Emergency Coordinator oversees the training and designation of QRT members in fire 
prevention techniques.

Customer and merchant care
The Company recommends customers and merchants to carefully go through the help pages 
that provide self-help. For queries and concerns that are not addressed through the help pages, 
the customers and merchants can contact the care team through the Paytm App and Paytm 
for Business App.
Customer queries -

Merchant queries -
In-app support: https://b.paytm.me/help-support (Please use via Mobile)
Contact: 0120-444 0440
Our in-app support channel is able to resolve a vast majority of customer complaints. In any 
uncommon scenario, where one wishes to escalate the concern to the next level, one needs to 
ensure that they have already exhausted the previous level(s) and their concern remains un-
resolved or not resolved to their satisfaction. This is not a channel but a reactive means to address 
those who raise concerns on social media.

Limitations
TUVI did not perform any assurance procedures 
on the prospective information disclosed in 
the Report, including targets, expectations, 
and ambitions. Consequently, TUVI draws no 
conclusion on the prospective information. 
During the assurance process, TUVI did not come 
across any limitation to the agreed scope of the 
assurance engagement. TUVI did not verify any 
ESG goals and claim through this assignment. 
TUVI disclaims any liability or co-responsibility 
1) for any decision a person or an entity would 
make based on this assurance statement and 
2) for any damages in case of erroneous data is 
reported. While, TUVI verified data with maximum 
sample desired for limited level of assurance; the 
responsibility for the authenticity of submitted 
data entirely lies with ‘Paytm’. TUVI has taken 
reference of the financial figures from the audited 
financial statements. ‘Paytm’ will be responsible 
for the appropriate application of the financial 
data. The application of this assurance statement 
is limited w.r.t SEBI circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-

Water
1.

offices is estimated based on the studies 
provided by the per day per employee 
water consumption as per CWGA studies.
Waste
1.	
The waste data was not monitored for the 
50 fleet offices; thus, the reported waste 
values are limited to the 20 regional offices.
2.	 The generated non-hazardous waste in 
the 20 regional offices is handed over to 
the land lord. Thus, traceability to disposal 
method is missing. Thus, all generated non-
hazardous waste is thus conservatively 
assumed to be landfilled.
Our Responsibility
TUVI's 
responsibility 
in 
relation 
to 
this 
engagement is to perform a limited level of 
assurance and to express a conclusion based 
on the work performed. Our engagement did not 
include an assessment of the adequacy or the 
effectiveness of Paytm's strategy, management 
of ESG-related issues or the sufficiency of 
the Report against BRSR reporting principles, 
other than those mentioned in the scope of the 
assurance. TUVI's responsibility regarding this 
verification is in reference to the agreed scope 
of work, which includes assurance of non-
financial quantitative and qualitative information 
(09 attributes as per Annexure I - Format of 
BRSR Core) disclosed by ‘Paytm’. Reporting

Conflict of Interest
In the context of BRSR requirements set by 
SEBI, addressing conflict of interest is crucial 
to maintain high integrity and independence 
of assurance engagements. As per SEBI 
guidelines, 
assurance 
providers 
need 
to 
disclose any potential conflict of interest 
that could compromise the independence or 
neutrality of their assessments. TUVI diligently 
identifies any relationships, affiliations, or 
financial interests that could potentially cause 
conflict of interest. We proactively implement 
measures to mitigate or manage these conflicts, 
ensuring independence and impartiality in our 
assurance engagements. We provide clear and 
transparent disclosures about any identified 
conflicts of interest in our assurance statement. 
We recognize that failure to address conflict 
of interest adequately could undermine the

creditability of the assurance process and the

we strictly adhere to SEBI guidelines and take 
necessary measures to avoid, disclose, or 
mitigate conflicts of interest effectively.

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
(a)	 Assessment of impairment in carrying value of investment in Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL) 
(Refer accompanying notes 6 & 41 to the Standalone Financial Statements)
The Company is a 39% shareholder in Paytm 
Payments Bank Limited (“PPBL”), which is treated 
as an associate entity of the Company.
On January 31, 2024, the RBI issued a Press 
Release, imposing significant restrictions on the 
business operation of PPBL and permitted only 
withdrawal/ utilization of the available balances by 
customers from their accounts. 
Considering the uncertainties pertaining to the 
above RBI notice on the underlying recoverable 
value of its investments, the management performed 
an impairment assessment on the carrying value of 
investment in PPBL. Such assessment was primarily 
on the basis of qualitative factors in light of the RBI 
press release, such as, the scaled down business 
operations of PPBL and its business prospects 
including restrictions affecting normal operations 
of the primary products such as wallet, likelihood of 
any regulatory developments. 
Based on the foregoing, the Company recorded an 
impairment loss of Rs 2,096 Mn, representing the 
entire residual carrying amount of the Company’s 
investment in PPBL.
Considering the inherent complexities and significant 
judgements involved, the assessment of above 
impairment was considered as a key audit matter.
Our procedures included the following:
 
 
We have read the Press Release and related 
FAQs issued by RBI in relation to imposition 
of 
significant 
restrictions 
on 
business 
operation of PPBL. 
 
 
We 
discussed 
with 
the 
Company’s 
management to obtain their understanding of 
the potential implication of the restrictions on 
the operation of PPBL, Tested the arithmetical 
accuracy of the equity accounting up to March 
31, 2024 and impairment loss recognised by 
the Company in respect of PPBL.
 
 
We 
obtained 
and 
read 
management 
assessment pertaining to impairment of its 
investment in PPBL. 
 
 
Tested 
the 
arithmetical 
accuracy 
of 
impairment loss.
 
 
We assessed adequacy of relevant disclosures 
as per applicable Ind AS.
Assessment of recoverable value of investment in subsidiaries and other associates (Refer accompanying 
notes 5 & 6 to the Standalone Financial Statements)
The 
Company 
has 
investments 
in 
various 
subsidiaries and other associates. Where an 
indication of impairment exists, the carrying value 
of an investment is assessed for impairment as per 
Ind AS 36 and where applicable an impairment loss 
is recognized. 
Our procedures included the following:
 
 
We evaluated the Company’s assessment for 
identification of indicators of impairment.
 
 
We obtained an understanding from the 
management, assessed and tested the design 
and operating effectiveness of the Company’s 
key controls over the impairment assessment 
including determination of recoverable value.

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The determination of recoverable value for 
impairment 
assessment 
involves 
significant 
management judgement/ estimates including the 
following key estimates:
i)	 Forecast of cash flows 
ii)	 Discount rates
iii)	Terminal growth rate 
iv)	Revenue market multiple
Considering the inherent complexities and 
significant judgements involved, the assessment 
of above impairment was considered as a key 
audit matter.
 
 
We evaluated the Company’s impairment model. 
This included assessing various assumptions 
used in the impairment model related to 
cash flows, discount rate, terminal value/ 
revenue market multiple, etc. used for material 
investments with assistance of valuation 
specialist wherever considered necessary.
 
 
We agreed relevant data with the latest 
budgets, actual past results and other 
supporting 
documents 
and 
checked 
the 
mathematical 
accuracy 
of 
the 
impairment model.
 
 
We assessed the Company’s sensitivity 
analysis 
and 
evaluated 
whether 
any 
reasonably 
foreseeable 
change 
in 
assumptions could lead to impairment or 
material change in the carrying value.
 
 
We assessed adequacy of relevant disclosures 
as per applicable accounting standards.
Other Information
The 
Company’s 
Board 
of 
Directors 
is 
responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included 
in the Annual report, but does not include 
the standalone financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial 
statements does not cover the other information 
and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the standalone 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read 
the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether such other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. 
The Annual report is not made available to us 
as at the date of this auditor’s report. We have 
nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management for 
the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the 
Act with respect to the preparation of these 
standalone financial statements that give a true 
and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance including other comprehensive 
income, cash flows and changes in equity of the 
Company in accordance with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 
specified under section 133 of the Act read with 
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also 
includes maintenance of adequate accounting 
173

Independent Auditor’s Report
records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the 
Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation 
and presentation of the standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In 
preparing 
the 
standalone 
financial 
statements, management is responsible for 
assessing the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the 
Company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible 
for 
overseeing 
the 
Company’s 
financial 
reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the standalone 
financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs 
will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these standalone 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we 
exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional 
skepticism 
throughout 
the 
audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the standalone financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control. 
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the 
Company has adequate internal financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
financial 
statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness 
of 
accounting 
estimates 
and 
related 
disclosures made by management. 
Financial Statements
174
Annual Report 
2024

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 208
Independent Auditor’s Report
•	
Conclude 
on 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Company to 
cease to continue as a going concern. 
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the standalone financial 
statements, 
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and whether the standalone financial 
statements 
represent 
the 
underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation. 
We communicate with those charged with 
governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.
We 
also 
provide 
those 
charged 
with 
governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the standalone financial statements for 
the financial year ended March 31, 2024 and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
The financial statements of the Company for 
the year ended March 31, 2023, included in 
these standalone financial statements, have 
been audited by the predecessor auditor who 
expressed an unmodified opinion on those 
statements on May 5, 2023.

Report on the Internal Financial 
Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls 
with 
reference 
to 
standalone 
financial 
statements of One 97 Communications Limited 
(“the Company”) as of March 31, 2024 in 
conjunction with our audit of the standalone 
financial statements of the Company for the 
year ended on that date.
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). 
These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to 
the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its 
assets, the prevention and detection of frauds 
and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on the Company's internal financial controls 
with reference to these standalone financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) 
and the Standards on Auditing, as specified 
under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to these standalone financial 
statements was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to 
obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of 
the internal financial controls with reference to 
these standalone financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to these standalone financial 
statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to 
these standalone financial statements.

Annexure 2 to the Independent Auditor’s report
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
With Reference to these Standalone 
Financial Statements
A company's internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements 
is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company's internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
generally 
accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Inherent 
Limitations 
of 
Internal 
Financial Controls With Reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error 
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial control with 
reference to standalone financial statements 
may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all 
material respects, adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements 
and 
such 
internal 
financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements were operating effectively as at 
March 31, 2024, based on the internal control 
over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

Act”). The registered office of the Company

place of business of the Company is in 
India. The equity shares of the Company

and merchants, wealth management etc. 
b) marketing services which primarily

ticketing business, providing voice and 
messaging 
platforms 
to 
the

other businesses, etc.
	
These Standalone Financial Statements 
(“Financial Statements”) were authorised 
for issue in accordance with a resolution of 
the Board of Directors on May 22, 2024.
2.	 Material accounting policies
2.1	Basis of preparation
	
These Financial Statements of the Company 
have been prepared in accordance with 
Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) 
prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Act read with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and 
other relevant provisions of the Act as 
amended from time to time.
	
The 
financial 
statements 
have 
been 
prepared on a historical cost basis, except 
for certain financial assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value and amortised cost 
(refer accounting policies on financial 
instruments and Share-based payments).
	
Accounting policies have been consistently 
applied except where a newly issued 
accounting standard is initially adopted or a 
revision to an existing accounting standard 
requires a change in the accounting policy 
hitherto in use.
	
All the amounts included in the financial 
statements are presented in Indian Rupees 
(‘Rupees’ or ‘Rs.’ or ‘INR’) and are rounded to 
the nearest millions, except per share data 
and unless stated otherwise.
	
New and amended standards adopted by 
the Company
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has 
notified Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023 dated 
31 March 2023 to amend the following 
Ind AS which are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. 
The Company applied for the first-time 
these amendments. 
	
(i)	 Definition of Accounting Estimates - 
Amendments to Ind AS 8
	
	
The amendments clarify the distinction 
between 
changes 
in 
accounting 
estimates and changes in accounting 
policies and the correction of errors. 
It has also been clarified how entities 
use 
measurement 
techniques

Annual Report

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
and inputs to develop accounting 
estimates. The amendments had no 
impact on the Company’s standalone 
financial statements. 
	
(ii)	 Disclosure of Accounting Policies - 		
Amendments to Ind AS 1
	
	
The amendments aim to help entities 
provide accounting policy disclosures 
that are more useful by replacing the 
requirement for entities to disclose their 
‘significant’ accounting policies with a 
requirement to disclose their ‘material’ 
accounting policies and adding guidance 
on how entities apply the concept of 
materiality in making decisions about 
accounting policy disclosures. 
	
	
The amendments have had an impact 
on the Company’s disclosures of 
accounting 
policies, 
but 
not 
on 
the 
measurement, 
recognition 
or 
presentation of any items in the 
Company’s financial statements.
	
(iii)	Deferred Tax related to Assets and 
Liabilities 
arising 
from 
a 
Single 
Transaction - Amendments to Ind AS 12
	
	
The amendments narrow the scope of 
the initial recognition exception under 
Ind AS 12, so that it no longer applies 
to transactions that give rise to equal 
taxable 
and 
deductible 
temporary 
differences such as leases. There 
was no impact of the change on the 
financial statements.
	
	
Apart 
from 
these, 
consequential 
amendments and editorials have been 
made to other Ind AS like Ind AS 101, 
Ind AS 102, Ind AS 103, Ind AS 107, Ind 
AS 109, Ind AS 115 and Ind AS 34.
2.2 Summary of material accounting 
policies
a.	
Current versus non-current classification
	
	
The Company presents assets and 
liabilities in the balance sheet based on 
current / non-current classification. 
	
	
An asset is classified as current when it 
is expected to be realised or intended 
to be sold or consumed in normal 
operating cycle, held primarily for the 
purpose of trading, expected to be 
realised within twelve months after 
the reporting period, or cash or cash 
equivalent unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability 
for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period. All other assets are 
classified as non-current.
	
	
A liability is classified as current when 
it is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle, it is held primarily 
for the purpose of trading, it is due 
to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or there 
is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting 
period. The Company classifies all 
other liabilities as non-current.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities, 
are classified as non-current assets 
and liabilities.

2024

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 229
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
The operating cycle is the time 
between the acquisition of assets for 
processing and their realisation in cash 
and cash equivalents. The Company 
has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
	
b.	
Fair value measurement
	
	
The 
Company 
measures 
certain 
financial instruments (e.g. investments) 
at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
	
	
Fair value is the price that would 
be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. 
	
	
The fair value measurement is based on 
the presumption that the transaction to 
sell the asset or transfer the liabilities 
takes place either in the principal 
market for the asset or liability or in 
absence of principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the 
asset or liability.
	
	
A fair value measurement of a non-
financial asset takes into account a 
market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to 
another market participant that would 
use the asset in its highest and best use.
	
	
The 
Company 
uses 
valuation 
techniques that are appropriate in the 
circumstances and for which sufficient 
data are available to measure fair 
value, maximising the use of relevant 
observable inputs and minimising the 
use of unobservable inputs.
	
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair 
value is measured or disclosed in the 
financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
	
	
Level 1- Quoted (Unadjusted) marked 
prices in the active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities
	
	
Level 2- Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement is directly 
or indirectly observable
	
	
Level 3- Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant 
to 
the 
fair 
value 
measurement 
is unobservable.
	
	
For assets and liabilities that are 
recognised in the financial statements 
on a recurring basis, the Company 
determines 
whether 
transfers 
have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy 
by re-assessing categorisation (based on 
the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) 
at the end of each reporting period.
	
	
At 
each 
reporting 
date, 
the 
management analyses the movements 
in the values of assets and liabilities 
which are required to be re-measured 
or re-assessed as per the Company’s 
accounting policies. For this analysis, 
the management or its expert verifies 
the major inputs applied in the latest 
valuation by agreeing the information in 
the valuation computation to contracts 
and other relevant documents.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, 
the Company has determined classes 
of assets and liabilities on the basis of 
the nature, characteristics and risks of 
the asset or liability and the level of the 
fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
c.	
Revenue recognition
	
	
Revenue is measured based on the 
consideration specified in a contract 
with a customer (transaction price) net 
of variable consideration e.g. discounts, 
volume rebates, any payments made to 
a customer (unless the payment is for a 
distinct good or service received from 
the customer) and excludes amounts 
collected on behalf of third parties. The 
Company recognises revenue when 
it transfers control over a product or 
service to a customer. Revenue is only 
recognised to the extent that it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal 
will not occur. 
	
	
The Company provides incentives to 
its users in various forms including 
cashbacks. 
Incentives 
which 
are 
consideration payable to the customer 
that are not in exchange for a 
distinct good or service are generally 
recognized as a reduction of revenue.
	
	
Where the Company acts as an agent 
for selling goods or services, only 
the commission income is included 
within revenue. The specific revenue 
recognition criteria described below 
must also be met before revenue is 
recognized. Typically, the Company 
has a right to payment before or at 
the point that services are delivered. 
Cash received before the services are 
delivered is recognised as a contract 
liability. The amount of consideration 
does not contain a significant financing 
component as payment terms are 
less than one year.
	
	
Sale of services 
	
	
Revenue from services is recognized 
when 
the 
control 
in 
services 
is 
transferred as per the terms of the 
agreement with customer i.e. as and 
when services are rendered. Revenues 
are disclosed net of the Goods and 
Services Tax charged on such services. 
In terms of the contract, excess of 
revenue over the billed at the year-
end is carried in the balance sheet as 
trade receivables where the amount is 
recoverable from the customer without 
any 
future 
performance 
obligation 
and the Company has unconditional 
right over such consideration (i.e. if 
only the passage of time is required 
before payment of such consideration 
is due). Cash received before the 
services are delivered is recognised as 
a contract liability.
	
	
Commission
	
	
The Company facilitates recharge of 
talk time, bill payments and availability 
of bus tickets and earns commission for 
the respective services. Commission 
income 
is 
recognized 
when 
the 
control in services is transferred to the 
customer when the services have been 
provided by the Company.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
Service fees from merchants
	
	
The Company earns service fee from 
merchants and recognizes such revenue 
when the control in services have been 
transferred by the Company i.e. as and 
when services have been provided 
by the Company. Such service fee is 
generally determined as a percentage 
of transaction value executed by the 
merchants. Amount received by the 
Company 
pending 
settlement 
are 
disclosed as payable to the merchants 
under other financial liabilities.
	
	
Government Grants
	
	
The Company recognises government 
grants only when there is reasonable 
assurance 
that 
the 
conditions 
attached to them will be complied 
with, and the grants will be received. 
Government grants related to revenue 
are recognized on a systematic basis in 
the Standalone Statement of Profit and 
Loss as other operating revenue over 
the periods necessary to match them 
with the related costs, if any, which 
they are intended to compensate.
	
	
Interest income
	
	
For all debt instruments measured 
either at amortised cost or at fair 
value through other comprehensive 
income, interest income is recorded 
using the effective interest rate (EIR). 
EIR is the rate that exactly discounts 
the estimated future cash payments 
or receipts over the expected life of 
the financial instrument or a shorter 
period, where appropriate, to the gross 
carrying amount of the financial asset 
or to the amortised cost of a financial 
liability. When calculating the effective 
interest rate, the Company estimates 
the expected cash flows by considering 
all the contractual terms of the financial 
instrument but does not consider the 
expected credit losses. Interest income 
is included in other income in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
d.	
Trade receivable
	
	
Trade receivables are amounts due 
from customers for services performed 
in the ordinary course of business and 
reflects group’s unconditional right 
to consideration (that is, payment 
is due only on the passage of time). 
Trade 
receivables 
are 
recognised 
initially at the transaction price as they 
do not contain significant financing 
components. The Company holds the 
trade receivables with the objective 
of collecting the contractual cash 
flows and therefore measures them 
subsequently at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less 
loss allowance. 
	
e.	
Taxes
	
	
Current income tax
	
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities 
are measured at the amount expected to 
be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws 
used to compute the amount are those 
that are enacted or substantively enacted, 
at the reporting date in the countries where 
the Company operates and generates 
taxable income.

Current income tax relating to items 
recognised outside statement of profit 
and loss is recognised either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity. 
Current tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction 
either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Management 
periodically 
evaluates 
positions taken in the tax returns 
with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject 
to interpretation and considers whether 
it is probable that a taxation authority 
will accept an uncertain tax treatment. 
The Company measures its tax balances 
either based on the most likely amount or 
the expected value, depending on which 
method provides a better prediction of 
the resolution of the uncertainty. 
 	
	
Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred 
tax 
is 
provided 
using 
the liability method on temporary 
differences between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred 
tax 
liabilities 
are 
recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences, except:
	
	
When the deferred tax liability arises 
from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit or loss.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for 
all deductible temporary differences, 
the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and any unused tax losses. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profit 
will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, and 
the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and unused tax losses can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each reporting 
date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred tax asset 
to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred 
tax assets are re-assessed at each 
reporting date and are recognised to 
the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable profits will allow the 
deferred tax asset to be recovered.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the year when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred 
tax 
relating 
to 
items 
recognised outside statement of profit 
and loss is recognised either in other

enforceable right exists to set off 
current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and the deferred taxes relate 
to the same taxable entity and the 
same taxation authority.
	
	
Taxes paid on acquisition of assets or 
on incurring expenses
	
	
Assets are recognised net of the 
amount of GST paid, except when the 
tax incurred on a purchase of assets 
is not recoverable from the taxation 
authority, in which case, the tax paid 
is recognised as part of the cost of 
acquisition of the asset.
	
	
Expenses are recognised net of the 
amount of GST paid, except when the 
tax incurred on a purchase of services 
is not recoverable from the taxation 
authority, in which case, the tax 
paid is expensed off in statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
The net amount of tax recoverable from, 
or payable to, the taxation authority is 
included as part of other current/ non- 
current assets or other current liabilities 
in the balance sheet.
	
f.	
Property, plant and equipment
	
	
Property, plant and equipment are 
carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment, if any. Property, plant and 
equipment is depreciated on a written 
down value basis to its residual value 
over its estimated useful life. 
	
	
Costs directly attributable to acquisition 
are capitalized until the property, plant 
and equipment are ready for use, as 
intended by the management. 
	
	
Subsequent costs are capitalised on 
the carrying amount or recognised 
as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when future economic benefits 
associated with the item are probable 
to flow to the Company and cost of the 
item can be measured reliably. When 
significant parts of property, plant and 
equipment are required to be replaced 
at intervals, the Company depreciates 
them separately based on their specific 
useful lives. The carrying amount of 
any component accounted for as a 
separate asset is derecognised when 
replaced. All repair and maintenance 
are charged to statement of profit 
and loss during the reporting period in 
which they are incurred.
	
	
Advances paid towards the acquisition 
of property, plant and equipment 
outstanding at each balance sheet 
date is classified as capital advances 
under the non-current assets and the 
cost of assets not ready to use before 
such date are disclosed under ‘Capital 
work in progress’.
	
	
The gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is determined 
as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset and is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss on the date 
of disposal or retirement.
	
	
Depreciation is provided using the written 
down value method, except for plant and

Leasehold 
improvements 
are

useful life or the lease term, unless the 
entity expects to use the assets beyond 
the lease term.
	
	
During the previous year, the Company 
had changed the method of depreciation 
for Plant & Machinery from written down 
value method to straight line method 
along with change in life to 3 years and 
2 years for EDC/POS machines and 
Sound box, respectively and the impact 
on account of such change in estimate 
was assessed to be immaterial for the 
current and future periods.
	
	
The residual values, useful lives and 
methods of depreciation of property, 
plant and equipment are reviewed at 
each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
	
g.	
Intangible assets
	
	
Separately acquired intangible assets, 
such as software are measured initially 
at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost 
less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Costs associated with maintaining 
software programmes are recognised 
as an expense as incurred. Development 
costs that are directly attributable to the 
design and testing of identifiable and 
unique software products controlled 
by the Company are recognised as 
intangible assets where the following 
criteria are met:
 
 
it is technically feasible to complete 
the software so that it will be 
available for use or sale
 
 
management intends to complete 
the software and use or sell it
 
 
there is an ability to use or 
sell the software
 
 
it can be demonstrated how the 
software will generate probable 
future economic benefits
 
 
adequate technical, financial and 
other resources to complete the 
development and to use or sell the 
software are available, and
 
 
the expenditure attributable to the 
software during its development 
can be reliably measured.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
Directly attributable costs that are 
capitalised as part of the software 
include employee costs.
	
	
Research and development costs
	
	
Research expenditure and development 
expenditure that do not meet the 
criteria above are recognised as an 
expense as incurred. Development 
costs previously recognised as an 
expense are not recognised as an asset 
in a subsequent period.
	
	
Amortization methods and periods
	
	
Amortization of intangible assets begins 
when development is complete and 
the asset is available for use. Software, 
licenses 
acquired 
and 
internally 
generated software are amortized at 
the rate of 40% per annum on written 
down value method. During the period 
of development, the asset is tested for 
impairment annually. The amortization 
period and the amortization method 
are reviewed at least at each financial 
year end. Changes in the expected 
useful life or the expected pattern 
of consumption of future economic 
benefits embodied in the asset are 
considered to modify the amortization 
period or method, as appropriate, and 
are treated as changes in accounting 
estimates. The amortization expense 
on intangible assets is recognized in 
the statement of profit and loss unless 
such expenditure forms part of carrying 
value of another asset.
	
	
Gains or losses arising from de-
recognition of an intangible asset are 
measured as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and are recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss when 
the asset is derecognized.
	
h.	
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
	
For 
all 
non-financial 
assets, 
the 
Company 
assesses 
whether 
there 
are indicators of impairment. If such 
an indicator exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss, if any. Where the asset 
does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the 
Company estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit 
(CGU) to which the asset belongs.
	
	
The recoverable amount for an asset or 
CGU is the higher of its value in use and 
fair value less costs of disposal. If the 
recoverable amount of an asset or CGU 
is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount, the asset or CGU is considered 
impaired and the carrying amount of 
the asset or CGU is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in the 
statement of profit and loss. 
	
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows of the asset or CGU are 
discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. 
In determining fair value less costs of 
disposal, recent market transactions are 
taken into account.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
If no such transactions can be identified, 
an appropriate valuation model is used. 
These calculations are corroborated by 
valuation multiples, quoted share prices 
for publicly traded companies or other 
available fair value indicators.
	
	
The Company bases its impairment 
calculation on detailed budgets and 
forecast calculations. These budgets 
and forecast calculations generally 
cover a period of five years. For longer 
periods, a long-term growth rate is 
calculated and applied to project future 
cash flows after the fifth year. To 
estimate cash flow projections beyond 
periods covered by the most recent 
budgets/forecasts, 
the 
Company 
extrapolates cash flow projections in 
the budget using a steady or declining 
growth rate for subsequent years, 
unless an increasing rate can be 
justified. In any case, this growth rate 
does not exceed the long-term average 
growth rate for the products, industries, 
or country or countries in which the 
entity operates, or for the market in 
which the asset is used.
	
	
An assessment is made at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is an 
indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or 
have decreased. If such indication 
exists, the Company estimates the 
asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. 
A previously recognised impairment 
loss is reversed only if there has been 
a change in the assumptions used 
to determine the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount since the last 
impairment loss was recognised. The 
reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed 
its recoverable amount, nor exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had 
no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset in prior years. Such reversal 
is recognised in the statement of 
profit or loss.
	
i.	
Provisions and contingencies
	
	
Provisions
	
	
Provisions are recognised when the 
Company has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a 
past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. 
	
	
When the Company expects some 
or all of a provision to be reimbursed, 
the reimbursement is recognised as 
a separate asset, but only when the 
reimbursement 
is 
virtually 
certain. 
The expense relating to a provision is 
presented in the statement of profit 
and loss net of any reimbursement.
	
	
If the effect of the time value of money 
is material, provisions are discounted 
using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, 
when appropriate, the risks specific to 
the liability. When discounting is used, 
the increase in the provision due to 
the passage of time is recognised as 
a finance cost.

Contingencies
	
	
A contingent liability is a possible 
obligation that arises from past events 
whose existence will be confirmed by 
the occurrence or non-occurrence of 
one or more uncertain future events 
beyond the control of the Company 
or a present obligation that is not 
recognized because it is not probable 
that an outflow of resources will be 
required 
to 
settle 
the 
obligation. 
A contingent liability also arises in 
extremely rare cases where there is 
a liability that cannot be recognized 
because it cannot be measured reliably. 
The Company does not recognize a 
contingent liability but discloses its 
existence in the financial statements.
	
j.	
Retirement and other employee benefits
	
	
For defined benefit plans (gratuity), 
the liability or asset recognised in the 
balance sheet is the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation at the 
end of the reporting period less the 
fair value of plan assets. The defined 
benefit obligation is calculated by 
an independent actuary using the 
projected unit credit method. 
	
	
The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows by 
reference to market yields at the end 
of the reporting period on government 
bonds that have terms approximating 
to the terms of the related obligation.
	
	
The net interest cost is calculated 
by applying the discount rate to the 
net balance of the defined benefit 
obligation and the fair value of plan 
assets. This cost is included in employee 
benefit expense in the statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
Re-measurement gains and losses 
arising from experience adjustments and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are 
recognised in the period in which they 
occur, directly in other comprehensive 
income. They are included in retained 
earnings in the statement of changes 
in equity and in the balance sheet. Re-
measurements are not reclassified to 
profit or loss in the subsequent periods.
	
	
Changes in the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation resulting 
from plan amendments or curtailments 
are recognised immediately in profit or 
loss as past service cost.
	
	
The 
Company’s 
contributions 
to 
defined contribution plans (provident 
fund) are recognized in profit or loss 
when the employee renders related 
service. The Company has no further 
obligations under these plans beyond 
its periodic contributions.
	
	
The Company provides for liability at 
period end on account of un-availed 
earned leave and Long Term Incentive 
Plan (‘LTIP’) as per actuarial valuation 
using projected unit credit method.
	
	
Liabilities for wages and salaries, 
including non-monetary benefits that 
are expected to be settled wholly

the related service are recognised in 
respect of employees' services up to 
the end of the reporting period and are 
measured at the amounts expected 
to be paid when the liabilities are 
settled. The liabilities are presented as 
employee benefit payable under other 
financial liabilities in the balance sheet.
	
	
The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‘Code’) 
relating to employee benefits during 
employment 
and 
post-employment 
benefits received Presidential assent in 
September 2020. The Code has been 
published in the Gazette of India. Certain 
sections of the code came into effect on 
May 3, 2023. However, the final rules/
interpretation have not yet been issued. 
Based on a preliminary assessment, the 
entity believes the impact of the change 
will not be significant.
	
k.	
Share-based payments
	
	
Equity-settled transactions
	
	
Employees (including senior executives) 
of the Company receive remuneration 
in the form of share-based payments, 
whereby employees render services as 
consideration for equity instruments 
(equity-settled transactions).
	
	
The cost of equity-settled transactions 
is determined by the fair value at the 
date when the grant is made using an 
appropriate valuation model.
	
	
That cost is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in 
Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) 
reserves in equity, over the period in 
which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee 
benefits 
expense. 
The 
cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date 
until the vesting date reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Company’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. The statement of profit 
and loss expense or credit for a period 
represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning 
and end of that period and is recognised 
in employee benefits expense.
	
	
Performance conditions which are 
market 
conditions 
are 
taken 
into 
account 
when 
determining 
the 
grant date fair value of the awards. 
Service and non-market performance 
conditions are not taken into account 
when determining the grant date fair 
value of awards, but the likelihood of 
the conditions being met is assessed 
as part of the Company’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest.
	
	
No expense is recognised for awards 
that do not ultimately vest because 
non-market 
performance 
and/or 
service conditions have not been met.
	
	
When the terms of an equity-settled 
award 
are 
modified, 
the 
minimum 
expense recognised is the expense 
had the terms not been modified, if the 
original terms of the award are met. An 
additional expense is recognised for 
any modification that increases the total 
fair value of the share-based payment 
transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to 
the employee as measured at the date of 
modification. Where an award is cancelled

by the entity or by the counterparty, any 
remaining element of the fair value of the 
award is expensed immediately through 
profit or loss.
	
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected as additional share 
dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
	
l.	
Financial instruments
	
	
A financial instrument is any contract 
that gives rise to a financial asset of 
one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.
	
	
Financial assets
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
All financial assets are recognised 
initially at fair value plus, in the case of 
financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs 
that are attributable to the acquisition 
of the financial asset. However, trade 
receivables that do not contain a 
significant financing component are 
measured at transaction price.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
For 
purposes 
of 
subsequent 
measurement, 
financial 
assets 
are 
classified in four categories:
 
 
Debt instruments at amortized cost
 
 
Debt instruments at fair value 
through 
other 
comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI)
 
 
Debt instruments, derivatives and 
equity instruments at fair value 
through profit or loss (FVTPL)
 
 
Equity instruments measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI)
	
	
Debt instruments at amortised cost
	
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the 
amortised cost if both the following 
conditions are met:
	
	
a)	 The asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold 
assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
	
	
b)	 Contractual terms of the asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial 
assets are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 
The EIR amortization is included in finance 
income in the profit or loss. The losses 
arising from impairment are recognised in 
the profit or loss. This category generally 
applies to trade and other receivables and 
is most relevant to the Company.
	
	
Debt instrument at FVTOCI
	
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at 
the FVTOCI if both of the following 
criteria are met:
	
	
a)	 The objective of the business model 
is achieved both by collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling 
the financial assets, and
Financial Statements
206
Annual Report 
2024

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
b)	 The asset’s contractual cash flows 
represent SPPI.
	
	
Debt instruments included within the 
FVTOCI category are measured initially 
as well as at each reporting date at 
fair value. Fair value movements are 
recognized in the other comprehensive 
income (OCI). However, the Company 
recognizes interest income, impairment 
losses 
and 
reversals 
and 
foreign 
exchange gain or loss in the statement of 
profit and loss. On derecognition of the 
asset, cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in OCI is reclassified from 
the equity to the statement of profit 
and loss. Interest earned whilst holding 
FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as 
interest income using the EIR method.
	
	
Debt instrument at FVTPL
	
	
FVTPL is a residual category for debt 
instruments. 
Any 
debt 
instrument, 
which does not meet the criteria for 
categorization as at amortized cost or 
as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
	
	
In addition, the Company may elect 
to designate a debt instrument, which 
otherwise meets amortized cost or 
FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, 
such election is allowed only if doing so 
reduces or eliminates a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency (referred to as 
‘accounting mismatch’). 
	
	
Debt instruments included within the 
FVTPL category are measured at fair 
value with all changes recognized in 
the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Equity investments
	
	
All equity investments in scope of 
Ind AS 109 are measured at fair 
value. The Company may make an 
irrevocable election to present in other 
comprehensive 
income 
subsequent 
changes in the fair value. The Company 
makes such election on an instrument-
by-instrument basis. The classification 
is made on initial recognition and 
is irrevocable.
	
	
If the Company decides to classify an 
equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all 
fair value changes on the instrument, 
excluding dividends, are recognized in 
the OCI. There is no recycling of the 
amounts from OCI to statement of profit 
or loss, even on sale of investment. 
However, the Company may transfer the 
cumulative gain or loss within equity.
	
	
Equity instruments included within the 
FVTPL category are measured at fair 
value with all changes recognized in 
the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
The equity securities which are not held 
for trading, and for which the Company 
has made an irrevocable election at initial 
recognition to recognize changes in fair 
value through OCI rather than profit or 
loss as these are strategic investments 
and the Company considered this to 
be more relevant.
	
	
Equity investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures are 
measured at cost. The investments 
are reviewed at each reporting date

to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment considering 
the provisions of Ind AS 36 ‘Impairment 
of Assets’. If any such indication exists,

assets is followed.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a 
part of a financial asset or part of a group 
of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised (i.e. removed from the 
Company’s balance sheet) when:
 
 
The rights to receive cash flows 
from the asset have expired, or
 
 
The Company has transferred its 
rights to receive cash flows from the 
asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party 
under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; 
and either (a) the Company has 
transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) the 
Company has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
	
	
When the Company has transferred 
its rights to receive cash flows from 
an asset or has entered into a pass-
through arrangement, it evaluates if 
and to what extent it has retained the 
risks and rewards of ownership. When 
it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of the asset, nor transferred control of 
the asset, the Company continues to 
recognise the transferred asset to the 
extent of the Company’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Company 
also recognises an associated liability. 
The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that the 
Company has retained.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the 
Company 
applies 
expected 
credit 
loss (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss 
on financial assets that are debt 
instruments, and are measured at 
amortised 
cost 
e.g., 
loans, 
debt 
securities, deposits, trade receivables 
and bank balance.
	
	
The 
Company 
follows 
‘simplified 
approach’ for recognition of impairment 
loss allowance on trade receivables. 
The application of simplified approach 
does not require the Company to 
track changes in credit risk. Rather, it 
recognises impairment loss allowance 
based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting 
date, right from its initial recognition. 
	
	
For recognition of impairment loss on 
other financial assets and risk exposure, 
the Company determines that whether 
there has been a significant increase in 
the credit risk since initial recognition. If 
credit risk has not increased significantly, 
12-month expected credit loss (ECL) 
is used to provide for impairment loss. 
However, if credit risk has increased 
significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a 
subsequent period, credit quality of the 
instrument improves such that there is 
no longer a significant increase in credit 
risk since initial recognition, then the

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
entity reverts to recognising impairment 
loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.
	
	
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit 
losses resulting from all possible 
default events over the expected life 
of a financial instrument. The 12-month 
ECL is a portion of the lifetime ECL 
which results from default events that 
are possible within 12 months after the 
reporting date. 
	
	
ECL is the difference between all 
contractual cash flows that are due 
to the Company in accordance with 
the contract and all the cash flows 
that the entity expects to receive 
(i.e., all cash shortfalls), discounted at 
the original EIR.
	
	
The Company uses a provision matrix 
to determine impairment loss allowance 
on portfolio of its trade receivables. 
The provision matrix is based on its 
historically observed default rates over 
the expected life of the trade receivables 
and is adjusted for forward-looking 
estimates. At every reporting date, the 
historical observed default rates are 
updated and changes in the forward-
looking estimates are analyzed.
	
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or 
reversal) recognized during the period 
is recognized as income/ expense in 
the statement of profit and loss. This 
amount is reflected under the head 
other expenses in the statement of 
profit and loss. For the financial assets 
measured as at amortised cost, ECL is 
presented as an allowance, i.e., as an 
integral part of the measurement of 
those assets in the balance sheet. The 
allowance reduces the net carrying 
amount. Until the asset meets write-off 
criteria, the Company does not reduce 
impairment allowance from the gross 
carrying amount.
	
	
Financial liabilities
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at 
initial recognition, as financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings, payables, or 
as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, 
as appropriate.
	
	
All financial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value and, in the 
case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs.
	
	
The 
Company’s 
financial 
liabilities 
include borrowings, lease liabilities, 
trade and other payables. 
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities 
depends on their classification as 
described below: 
	
	
Loans and borrowings
	
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using 
the EIR method. Gains and losses are 
recognised in profit or loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through the EIR amortisation process.
	
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that 
209

Financial Statements

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included as finance 
costs in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised 
when the obligation under the liability 
is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is 
replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, 
or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an 
exchange or modification is treated as 
the derecognition of the original liability 
and the recognition of a new liability. 
The 
difference 
in 
the 
respective 
carrying amounts is recognised in the 
statement of profit or loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities 
are offset and the net amount is 
reported in the balance sheet if there 
is a currently enforceable legal right 
to offset the recognised amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net 
basis, to realise the assets and settle 
the liabilities simultaneously.
	
m.	 Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the 
standalone balance sheet comprise 
cash at banks and on hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less, which are 
subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
	
	
For the purpose of the standalone 
statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and short-
term deposits, as defined above, net 
of outstanding bank overdrafts as they 
are considered an integral part of the 
Company’s cash management.
	
n.	
Leases
	
	
The Company as a lessee
	
	
The Company’s lease asset classes 
primarily consist of leases for land and 
office premises. The Company assesses 
whether a contract contains a lease, 
at inception of a contract. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration. To assess 
whether a contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset, 
the Company assesses whether: (i) the 
contact involves the use of an identified 
asset (ii) the Company has substantially 
all of the economic benefits from use 
of the asset through the period of the 
lease and (iii) the Company has the 
right to direct the use of the asset.
	
	
At the date of commencement of 
the lease, the Company recognizes 
a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, 
except for leases with a term of twelve 
months or less (short-term leases) and 
low value leases. For these short-term 
and low value leases, the Company 
recognizes the lease payments as an 
operating expense on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
	
	
Certain lease arrangements includes 
the options to extend or terminate the 
lease before the end of the lease term.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably 
certain that they will be exercised.
	
	
The right-of-use assets are initially 
recognized at cost, which comprises 
the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made 
at or prior to the commencement 
date of the lease plus any initial direct 
costs less any lease incentives. They 
are subsequently measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any.
	
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated 
from the commencement date on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of 
the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. Right of use assets are 
evaluated for recoverability whenever 
events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, the recoverable 
amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value 
less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is 
determined on an individual asset basis 
unless the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are largely independent of 
those from other assets. In such cases, 
the recoverable amount is determined 
for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to 
which the asset belongs.
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured 
at amortized cost at the present 
value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted 
using the interest rate implicit in the 
lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates 
in the country of domicile of these 
leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured 
with a corresponding adjustment to 
the related right of use asset if the 
Company changes its assessment if 
whether it will exercise an extension or 
a termination option.
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been 
separately presented in the standalone 
balance sheet and lease payments have 
been classified as financing cash flows.
	
o.	
Earnings/ (loss) per share (EPS)
	
	
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by 
dividing the profit/ (loss) for the year 
attributable to equity holders by the 
weighted average number of Equity 
shares outstanding during the year.
	
	
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by 
dividing the profit/ (loss) attributable to 
equity holders by the weighted average 
number of Equity shares outstanding 
during the year plus the weighted 
average number of Equity shares that 
would be issued on conversion of all 
the dilutive potential Equity shares into 
Equity shares. 
	
p.	
Segment reporting
	
	
Operating segments are reported in 
a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The Chief Operating 
decision-maker 
is 
responsible 
for 
allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments 
and makes strategic decisions.

q.	
Use of estimates 
	
	
The Company is required to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect 
the 
reported 
amounts 
of 
assets, 
liabilities, 
disclosure 
of 
contingent 
liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts 
of 
revenue 
and 
expenses 
during 
the reporting period. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates. 
The Company bases its estimates on 
historical experience and on various 
other assumptions that are believed to 
be reasonable, the results of which form 
the basis for making judgements about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities.
	
r.	
Exceptional Items
	
	
On certain occasions, the size, type 
or incidence of an item of income or 
expense, pertaining to the ordinary 
activities of the Company is such that its 
disclosure improves the understanding 
of the performance of the Company. 
Such income or expense is classified 
as an exceptional item and accordingly 
disclosed in the financial statements. 
Significant impact on the financial 
statements arising from impairment and 
non-recurring events are considered 
and reported as exceptional items.

The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Company 
becomes obliged to exercise (or not exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty 
is only revised if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs, which 
affects this assessment, and that is within the control of the lessee. The Company has given 
notice to vacate certain office premises. This has been accounted as lease termination. Hence, 
in accordance with Ind AS 116, Lease Liability has been re-measured by INR 204 ( March 31, 
2023: 9) with corresponding adjustment to Right of Use assets amounting to INR 185 (March 
31, 2023: 8) and the remaining balance has been included in Miscellaneous Income disclosed 
under Other Income in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
The total cash outflow for leases for the year ended is INR 440 (March 31, 2023: 554)
	
Extension and termination options:
	
Extension and termination options are included in certain leases. These are used to maximise 
operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Company’s operations. In 
certain cases, the extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Company 
and not by the respective lessor.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
on May 24, 2023, the Company has filed a claim with the IRP for recovery of outstanding 
balances. Pending outcome of the insolvency proceedings, the management has provided for 
the balance INR 57 as exceptional item in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss.
b)	 During the Current year ended March 31, 2024, the Company has recognized provision for 
impairment in the carrying value of its investment in its associate, Infinity Transoft Solutions 
Private Limited of INR 20 and during the previous year March 31, 2023, in carrying value of 
its investments in its subsidiaries, Orbgen Technologies Private Limited, Paytm Insurance 
Broking Private Limited and Little Internet Private Limited of INR 104, INR 525 and INR 
1 respectively. The provision for impairment has been shown as an exceptional item in 
the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. During the current and previous years, the 
impairment losses for these investments was based on the equity value calculated based on 
cash flow projections with the business plan used for impairment testing using discounted 
cash flow method. The management has computed equity value based on discount rate 
of 20.8% (March 31, 2023: 22.5%) and terminal growth rate used in extrapolating cash 
flows beyond the planning period of 2.45 (March 31, 2023: 2.45) times of revenue of the 
terminal year.	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
22. Earnings per shares (EPS)
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/ (loss) for the year attributable to equity 
holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/ (loss) for the year attributable to equity 
holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the 
year plus the weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued on conversion of all 
the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
23. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Company’s Standalone Financial Statements requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, 
assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.	
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next 12 months, are described below.
Deferred taxes
Deferred tax assets can be recognised for deductible temporary differences (including unused 
tax losses) only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. As the Company is yet to generate operating 
profits, Management has assessed that as at March 31, 2024 it is not probable that such deferred 
tax assets can be realised in excess of available taxable temporary differences. Management re-
assesses unrecognised deferred tax assets at each reporting date and recognises to the extent 
that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be 
recovered. For details about deferred tax assets, refer note 27.
During FY 2019-20 (AY 2020-21) a shareholder of the Company holding 30.33% of shares of 
the Company had transferred its shareholding to its group company (both entities being 100% 
subsidiaries of the same ultimate parent entity). Based on advice from the Company's tax experts, 
Management has assessed that a mere change in shareholding within the same group will not be 
an affirmative position to say that the shareholding has been changed. Further, since the shares 
of the Company carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power were beneficially held 
by persons, i.e. ultimate holding company of the aforesaid entities, who beneficially held shares 
of the company carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power on the last day of the 
year or years in which the loss was incurred, the Company shall be entitled to carry forward and 
set off these losses against the taxable income of future years in accordance with the provisions 
of Section 79 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. (Refer note 27)
Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits) 
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are 
determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions 
that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the 
discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the 
valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in 
these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
23. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
(Contd..)
In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated in India, the management 
considers the interest rates of government bonds in India. The mortality rate is based on publicly 
available mortality tables for India. The mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response 
to demographic changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected 
future inflation rates. For further details about gratuity obligations, refer note 26.
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the standalone balance 
sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured 
using valuation techniques including the DCF model, Price of Recent Investment (PORI) method 
and Comparable Company Multiples (CCM) method. The inputs to these models are taken from 
observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is 
required in establishing fair values. For further details about Fair value measurement, refer note 30.
Impairment of financial assets
The Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit risk associated with its 
assets carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there 
has been a significant increase in credit risk. Note 31 details how the Company determines whether 
there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
Impairment reviews
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are tested for impairment at-least on an annual basis 
or when events that occur / changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount is less 
than its carrying value. In calculating the value in use, the Company is required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions inter-alia concerning the growth in EBITDA, long-term growth rates; 
discount rates to reflect the risks involved. The carrying value is less than the net worth of certain 
subsidiaries. The Company basis the underlying business and future business projections, does not 
consider there to be any diminution in the value of such investments. For details about impairment 
reviews, refer note 21.	
The Company has investment in PPBL, an associate. During the year, given certain developments, 
the Company has recorded impairment of 100% carrying value. A qualitative assessment requires 
significant judgement (refer note 41)
Incentives
The Company provides incentives to users in various forms including cash backs to promote our 
platform. Incentives to users to whom the Company has a performance obligation is recorded as a 
reduction of revenue to the extent of the revenue earned. For the incentives to other transacting 
Financial Statements

2024

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
users to whom the Company has no performance obligation, management is required to determine 
whether the incentives are in substance a payment on behalf of the merchants and should 
therefore be recorded as a reduction of revenue or as marketing and promotional expenses. Some 
of the factors considered in management’s evaluation of such incentives being payments on behalf 
of  merchants include whether the incentives are given at the Company’s discretion, contractual 
agreements with the merchants, business strategy and objectives and design of the incentive 
program(s), etc. 
Share-based payments 
Employees of the Company receive remuneration in the form of share based payment instruments, 
whereby employees render services to group and receive equity instrument of Holding Company 
as consideration (equity-settled transactions). In accordance with the Ind AS 102 Share Based 
Payments, the cost of equity-settled transactions is measured using the fair value method. The 
cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the company's best 
estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
24. Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOP)

26. Gratuity
The Company provides for gratuity for employees in India as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. 
Employees who are in continuous service for a period of 5 years are eligible for gratuity. The amount 
of gratuity payable on retirement/termination is the employees last drawn basic salary per month 
computed proportionately for 15 days salary multiplied for the number of years of service upto a 
limit of INR 20 Lakhs. The gratuity plan is a funded plan and the Company makes contributions to 
recognised fund/insurer in India. The Company does not fully fund the liability and maintains a target 
level of funding to be maintained over a period of time based on estimations of expected gratuity 
payments. Disclosures given below are as per actuarial valuation report of independent Actuary.
The following tables summarize the components of net benefit expenses recognized in the 
Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss and the funded status and amount recognized in the

preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior year.	
	
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the period ending March 31, 
2025 are INR 1064 (March 31, 2024 - INR 254).
	
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 4 years (March 31, 2023- 
2.79 years).

Risk exposure
	
Through its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most 
significant of which are detailed below:
	
Asset volatility: The plan assets are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to 
bond yields. If plan assets underperform this yield, there will be a deficit of the plan asset 
investments in fixed income securities with high grades and in government securities. These 
are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk to an acceptable level.
	
Changes in bond yields: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based 
on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
	
Inflation risks: The payments are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.
	
Life expectancy: Obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in 
life expectancy and inflation will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. This is particularly 
significant where inflationary conditions result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.
	
Major categories of plans assets are as follows:

31. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk 
and liquidity risk. The Company continues to focus on a system-based approach to business 
risk management. The Company’s financial risk management process seeks to enable the early 
identification, evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business. Backed by strong 
internal control systems, the current Risk Management Framework rests on policies and procedures 
issued by appropriate authorities; process of regular internal reviews/audits to set appropriate risk 
limits and controls; monitoring of such risks and compliance confirmation for the same.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
a.	 Market Risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market prices. Market prices comprise three types of risk: interest rate 
risk, foreign currency risk and price risk. The Company has in place appropriate risk management 
policies to limit the impact of these risks on its financial performance. The Company ensures 
optimization of cash through fund planning and robust cash management practices.
	
(i)	 Interest Rate Risk
	
	
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial 
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. There is no interest 
rate risk as the Company did not have borrowings at the end of the current and previous year.
	
(ii)	 Price risk
	
	
The Company invests its surplus funds in fixed deposits, Commercial papers, Treasury bills, 
Government Securities, Certificate of deposits and non-convertible debentures. There is 
no exposure of price risk on such instruments.
	
	
The Company is also exposed to equity/ preference shares price risk arising from investments 
held by the Company and classified in the balance sheet either as fair value through OCI 
or at fair value through profit or loss (refer note 7(a) and 7(b)). To manage its price risk 
arising from investments in equity/ preference shares, the company diversifies its portfolio. 
Diversification of the portfolio is done in accordance with the limits set by the company.
	
(iii)	Foreign currency risk
	
	
The Indian Rupee is the Company’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the 
Company’s results are presented in Indian Rupee and exposures are managed against 
Indian Rupee accordingly. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash 
flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The 
Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to 
the Company’s operating activities and investing activities (when revenue, expense and 
Property, Plant and Equipment is denominated in a foreign currency).

The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity of profit or loss to a reasonably possible

The Company’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material. 
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a reasonably possible change in the under-
lying foreign currency against the functional currency while assuming all other variables 
to be constant.
	
	
Based on the movements in the foreign exchange rates historically and the prevailing 
market conditions as at the reporting date, the Company’s management has concluded 
that the above mentioned rates used for sensitivity are reasonable benchmarks.
b.	 Credit Risk
	
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument 
or contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating 
activities (primarily trade receivables) including deposits with banks. Management has a credit 
policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. The Company 
applies expected credit loss (ECL) model on financial assets measured at amortised cost e.g., 
loans, debt securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank balance. Cash and cash equivalents 
are also subject to the impairment requirement of Ind AS 109, the identified impairment loss 
was immaterial.
	
All of the entity's investments and loans at amortised cost are considered to have low credit 
risk, and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 months 
expected losses. Management considers instruments to be low credit risk when they have 
a low risk of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow 
obligations in the near term.

(i)	 Trade receivables
	
	
The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-payment by customers. Customer 
credit risk is managed subject to the Company’s established policy, procedures and control 
relating to customer credit risk management. An impairment analysis is performed at each 
reporting date by grouping the receivables in homogeneous group. The calculation is based 
on lifetime expected credit losses.

31. Financial risk management objectives and policies (Contd..)
	
(ii)	 Other investments (excluding loans to related parties)
	
	
All of the entity’s other investments (preference shares, government securities, commercial 
papers, treasury bills and security deposits) at amortised cost are considered to have low 
credit risk, and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 
months’ expected losses. Management consider ‘low credit risk’ for listed instruments to be 
an investment grade credit rating with at least one major rating agency. Other instruments 
are considered to have low credit risk when they have a low risk of default and the issuer 
has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.
	
(iii)	Loan to related parties
	
	
The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of loan and 
whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout 
each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the 
Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the loan as at the reporting date with 
the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and 
supportive forwarding-looking information.
	
(iv)	Other financial assets
	
	
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Company’s 
treasury department in accordance with the Company’s policy. Investment of surplus funds 
is made only with banks of high repute.
	
	
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet at 
March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is the carrying amounts as disclosed in Note 7 (c) and 7 (d).

41. On January 31, 2024, the RBI issued a Press Release for action against Paytm Payments Bank 
Ltd (PPBL), a 39% associate of the Company, under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 
1949, effectively restricting PPBL’s normal business, permitting only withdrawal of the existing 
customer balances. 
Pursuant to the RBI’s actions as stated above, the Company has terminated its Nodal Accounts 
being maintained with PPBL. Subsequently, the Company has discontinued all major business 
activities it had with PPBL. Further, the Company has also made amendment to the shareholders 
agreement with PPBL by simplifying the terms therein and has also withdrawn its nominee director 
from the board of PPBL.
The business of PPBL has been significantly impacted by the RBI action as described above. As at 
March 31, 2024, the Company has investments in PPBL amounting to INR 2,096 million.
The Company understand that there are certain factors affecting ongoing operations of PPBL, 
including restrictions which affect normal operations of the primary products such as wallet and 
banking services etc. as per regulatory action on Jan 31, 2024, as well as ongoing uncertainty on 
the timing and nature of restoration of any of the impacted services.
Considering the future uncertainties associated on the business operations of PPBL as mentioned 
above, including the uncertainty of any other regulatory development, the scaled down business 
operations of PPBL, restrictions affecting normal operations of the primary products such as saving 
accounts, current accounts, wallet, the management, on a prudent basis, has determined that 
the value of the Company’s investment in PPBL is impaired and, accordingly, has recorded an 
impairment provision of INR 2,096 million, representing the carrying value of its investment in PPBL 
and disclosed the same as impairment of investment in associate.
42. The Company during the year ended March 31, 2022 granted 21,000,000 Employee Stock 
Options to Managing Director and CEO of the Company which is subject to achievement of specified 
milestones. During the current year, the Company has received a Show Cause Notice (“SCN”) from 
SEBI related to the above options regarding compliance with SEBI SBEB Regulations. The Company 
has submitted its preliminary response and is in the process of seeking further information from 
SEBI in this regard. Based on an independent legal opinion obtained by the management, it believes 
that the Company is compliant with the relevant regulations. Accordingly, there is no impact on the 
financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.
(xiii) Registration of charges or satisfaction with Registrar of Companies
	
There are no charges or satisfaction which are yet to be registered with the Registrar of 
Companies beyond the statutory period.
(xiv) Utilisation of borrowings availed from banks and financial institutions.
	
The Company has not availed any borrowings from banks and financial institutions during the 
current year and previous year.

43.  The Company has used accounting software for maintaining its books of account which has a 
feature of recording audit trail (edit log) facility and the same has operated throughout the year for 
all relevant transactions recorded in the software except that, audit trail feature is not enabled and 
thus not operated for certain changes made using privileged access rights. The audit trail feature 
has not been tampered with in respect of such accounting software.
The feature of recording audit trail (edit log) facility was not enabled for certain subs-systems 
and certain applications, operated by third party software service provider, used for processing 
underlying transactions. Due to the same, management is unable to verify if there have been any 
instances of the audit trail feature being tampered with.
The management is in process of evaluating appropriate measures to enable audit trail 
in these systems.
44. During the previous year ended March 31, 2022, the Company had transferred online 
Payment Aggregator business to Paytm Payments Services Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of the Company for a consideration of INR 2,838 for transfer of business based on the carrying 
value of the net assets of the business as on September 1, 2021 to be settled in five equal annual 
installments payable at the end of each year without any interest. The difference between present 
value of consideration and net assets amounting to INR 601 has been accounted as 'Deemed 
Investment'. As at year end the balance amounts to INR 1,521 (INR 516 being current and INR 1,005 
classified as non-current).
45. For impairment testing, the management has treated investment in PPBL as a separate CGU 
and there is no change is the composition of this CGU since previous estimate of its recoverable 
amount. The impairment loss pertains to single segment as identified in note 33.
Considering the factors stated in note 41, the Company has determined, on a prudent basis, that 
both the value-in-use and fair value less cost of disposal of the Company’s investment in PPBL are 
nil at the reporting date. Since the management has used qualitative factors to determine value-
in-use as well as fair value less cost of disposal of the Company’s investment in PPBL, separate 
disclosures such as fair value hierarchy, valuation technique and assumptions used including 
discount rate are not separately given.
46. Previous year figures have been audited by a firm of Chartered Accountants other than S.R. 
Batliboi & Associates LLP.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of One 97 Communications Limited
Report on the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements of One 97 Communications 
Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding 
Company”), 
its 
subsidiaries 
(the 
Holding 
Company and its subsidiaries together referred to 
as “the Group”) its associates and joint ventures 
comprising of the consolidated Balance sheet as 
at March 31, 2024, the consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss, including other comprehensive 
income, the consolidated Cash Flow Statement 
and the consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the 
consolidated financial statements, including a 
summary of material accounting policies and other 
explanatory information (hereinafter referred to 
as “the consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us and 
based on the consideration of reports of other 
auditors on separate financial statements and on 
the other financial information of the subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures, the aforesaid 
consolidated financial statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013, 
as amended (“the Act”) in the manner so required 
and give a true and fair view in conformity with 
the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the 
Group, its associates and  joint ventures as at 
March 31, 2024, their consolidated loss including 
other comprehensive income, their consolidated 
cash flows and the consolidated statement of 
changes in equity for the year ended on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under 
section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities 
under those Standards are further described 
in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements’ 
section of our report. We are independent 
of the Group, associates, joint ventures in 
accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India together with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements under the provisions of the Act and 
the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements and the Code of Ethics. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements.
Emphasis of Matter
We draw attention to Note 42 to the Financial 
Statements which describes that the subsidiary 
company's application for authorization to set 
up Payment System, to the Department of 
Payment and Settlement Systems, Reserve 
Bank of India (“RBI”), is in process due to the 
reasons stated in the said note. Accordingly, no 
adjustment has been made by the management 
in these Financial Statements. Our opinion is 
not modified in respect of this matter
Key Audit Matters

in our professional judgment, were of most 
significance in our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements for the financial year ended 
March 31, 2024. These matters were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a

separate opinion on these matters. For each 
matter below, our description of how our audit 
addressed the matter is provided in that context. 
We have determined the matters described below 
to be the key audit matters to be communicated 
in our report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities 
described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements 
section of our report, including in relation to

statements. The results of audit procedures 
performed by us and by other auditors of 
components not audited by us, as reported by 
them in their audit reports furnished to us by 
the management, including those procedures 
performed to address the matters below, 
provide the basis for our audit opinion on the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Assessment of carrying value of investment in Paytm Payments Bank Limited (“PPBL”) (Refer 
accompanying notes 5 (b) and 45 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
The Company is a 49% shareholder in Paytm 
Payments Bank Limited (“PPBL”), which is treated as 
an associate entity of the Company.
The Group’s investments in  its  associate are 
accounted for using the equity method as required 
under the Ind AS 28. Under the equity method, the 
investment in an associate is initially recognised 
at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is 
adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of 
net assets of the associate since the acquisition date.
On January 31, 2024, the RBI issued a Press Release, 
imposing significant restrictions on the business 
operation of PPBL and permitted only withdrawal/ 
utilisation of the available balances by customers 
from their accounts.
Considering the uncertainties pertaining to the above 
RBI notice on the underlying recoverable value of 
its investments, the management performed an 
impairment assessment on the carrying value of 
investment in PPBL. Such assessment was primarily 
on the basis of qualitative factors in light of the RBI 
press release, such as, the scaled down business 
operationsof PPBL and its business prospects 
including restrictions affecting normal operations of 
the primary products such as wallet, likelihood of any 
regulatory developments, as well as non-availability 
of 
audited 
financial 
information 
from 
PPBL. 
Our procedures included the following:
 
 
We have read the Press Release and related 
FAQs issued by RBI in relation to imposition 
of 
significant 
restrictions 
on 
business 
operation of PPBL. 
 
 
We 
discussed 
with 
the 
Company’s 
management to obtain their understanding of 
the potential implication of the restrictions on 
the operation of PPBL, tested the arithmetical 
accuracy of the equity accounting up to March 
31, 2024 and impairment loss recognized by 
the Company in respect of PPBL.
 
 
We obtained and read the management 
assessment pertaining to impairment of its 
investment in PPBL.
 
 
We 
assessed 
adequacy 
of 
relevant 
disclosures in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements on the basis of unaudited financial 
information of PPBL.

Independent Auditor’s Report
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Based on the foregoing, the Group recorded an 
impairment loss of Rs 2,271 million, representing the 
entire residual carrying amount of the Company’s 
investment in PPBL.
Considering the inherent complexities and significant 
judgements involved, the assessment of above 
impairment was considered as a key audit matter. 
Assessment of impairment of goodwill relating to acquisition of subsidiaries and assessment of 
appropriateness of the carrying value of investments in other associates (Refer accompanying notes 4 & 5 
(b) to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
The Group performed an impairment assessment 
over the goodwill balance by calculating the 
recoverable value of the cash generating unit (CGU) 
to which the Goodwill belongs using   a discounted 
cash flow model and comparing the same with the 
carrying value of goodwill as per Ind AS 36. For the 
purpose of impairment assessment, each subsidiary 
is considered as separate CGU.
Further, there are certain investments in associates 
which are carried at cost (subject to impairment 
assessment).
The 
determination 
of 
recoverable 
value 
for 
impairment 
assessment 
involves 
significant 
management judgement/ estimates including the 
following key estimates:
i)	 Forecast of cash flows 
ii)	 Discount rates
iii)	Terminal growth rate 
iv)	Revenue market multiple
Considering the inherent complexities and significant 
judgements involved, the assessment of above 
(including investments in associates) impairment 
was considered as a key audit matter.
Our procedures included the following:
 
 
We evaluated the Company’s assessment for 
identification of indicators of impairment.
 
 
We obtained an understanding from the 
management, assessed and tested the design 
and operating effectiveness of the Company’s 
key controls over the impairment assessment 
including determination of recoverable value .
 
 
We evaluated the Company’s impairment model. 
This included assessing various assumptions 
used in the impairment model related to 
cash flows, discount rate, terminal value/ 
revenue market multiple, etc. used for material 
investments with assistance of valuation 
specialist wherever considered necessary.
 
 
We agreed relevant data with the latest budgets, 
actual past results and other supporting 
documents and checked the mathematical 
accuracy of the impairment model.
 
 
We 
assessed 
the 
Company’s 
sensitivity 
analysis and evaluated whether any reasonably 
foreseeable change in assumptions could 
lead to impairment or material change in the 
carrying value.
 
 
We assessed adequacy of relevant disclosures 
as per applicable accounting standards

Independent Auditor’s Report
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs 
will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we 
exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional 
skepticism 
throughout 
the 
audit. We also:
a)	 Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design 
and 
perform 
audit 
procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control. 
b)	 Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the 
Holding Company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial 
statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
c)	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness 
of 
accounting 
estimates 
and 
related 
disclosures made by management. 
d)	 Conclude 
on 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on 
the ability of the Group and its associates and 
joint ventures to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in 
our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group and its 
associates and joint ventures to cease to 
continue as a going concern. 
e)	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the consolidated financial 
statements, 
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and whether the consolidated financial 
statements 
represent 
the 
underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation. 
f)	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the

Independent Auditor’s Report
entities or business activities within the 
Group and its associates and joint ventures 
of which we are the independent auditors, 
to express an opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements. We are responsible for 
the direction, supervision and performance 
of the audit of the financial statements of 
such entities included in the consolidated 
financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors. For the other entities 
included in the consolidated financial 
statements, which have been audited by 
other auditors, such other auditors remain 
responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the audits carried out 
by them. We remain solely responsible for 
our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with 
governance of the Holding Company and such 
other entities included in the consolidated 
financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other 
matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We 
also 
provide 
those 
charged 
with 
governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements 
for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
a)	 We did not audit the financial statements 
and other financial information, in respect of 
6 subsidiaries, whose financial statements 
include total assets of Rs 19,014 million 
as at March 31, 2024, and total revenues 
of Rs 4,147 million and net cash inflows of 
Rs 78 million for the year ended on that 
date. These financial statement and other 
financial information have been audited by 
other auditors, which financial statements, 
other financial information and auditor’s 
reports have been furnished to us by the 
management. The consolidated financial 
statements also include the Group’s share 
of net loss of Rs. 12 million for the year 
ended March 31, 2024, as considered in 
the consolidated financial statements, in 
respect of four associates and one joint 
ventures, whose financial statements, other 
financial information have been audited 
by other auditors and whose reports have 
been furnished to us by the Management. 
Our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, in so far as it relates to the 
amounts 
and 
disclosures 
included 
in 
respect of these subsidiaries, joint ventures 
and associates, and our report in terms 
of sub-sections (3) of Section 143 of the 
Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates,

Report on the Internal Financial 
Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of One 97 Communications 
Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding 
Company”) as of and for the year ended March 
31, 2024, we have audited the internal financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
consolidated 
financial statements of the Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries together referred to as 
“the Group”), its associates and joint ventures, 
which are companies incorporated in India, 
as of that date. 
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal Financial Controls 
The respective Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group, its associates 
and joint ventures, which are companies 
incorporated in India, are responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the 
Holding Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the 
design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to the respective company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the 
Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on the Holding Company's internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) 
and the Standards on Auditing, specified 
under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls, both, issued by ICAI. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls 
with 
reference 
to 
consolidated 
financial 
statements was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to 
obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of 
the internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control

Annexure 2 to the Independent Auditor’s report
based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained and the audit evidence obtained by 
the other auditors in terms of their reports 
referred to in the Other Matters paragraph 
below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
With 
Reference 
to 
Consolidated 
Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with 
reference to consolidated financial statements 
is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company's internal financial control with 
reference to consolidated financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
generally 
accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Inherent 
Limitations 
of 
Internal 
Financial Controls With Reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements, including the possibility of 
collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error 
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

Indian Rupees (‘Rupees’ or ‘Rs.’ or ‘INR’) and 
are rounded to the nearest millions, except 
per share data and unless stated otherwise.
	
New and amended standards adopted by the 
Group 
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Amendment Rules, 2023 dated 31 March 
2023 to amend the following Ind AS which 
are effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 April 2023. The Group applied 
for the first-time these amendments.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
(i)	 Definition of Accounting Estimates - 
Amendments to Ind AS 8
	
	
The amendments clarify the distinction 
between 
changes 
in 
accounting 
estimates and changes in accounting 
policies and the correction of errors. 
It has also been clarified how entities 
use 
measurement 
techniques 
and inputs to develop accounting 
estimates. The amendments had no 
impact on the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements. 
	
(ii)	 Disclosure of Accounting Policies - 
Amendments to Ind AS 1
	
	
The amendments aim to help entities 
provide accounting policy disclosures 
that are more useful by replacing the 
requirement for entities to disclose 
their ‘significant’ accounting policies 
with a requirement to disclose their 
‘material’ 
accounting 
policies 
and 
adding guidance on how entities 
apply the concept of materiality in 
making decisions about accounting 
policy disclosures. 
	
	
The amendments have had an impact on 
the Group’s disclosures of accounting 
policies, but not on the measurement, 
recognition or presentation of any 
items in the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.
	
(iii)	Deferred Tax related to Assets and 
Liabilities 
arising 
from 
a 
Single 
Transaction - Amendments to Ind AS 12
	
	
The amendments narrow the scope of 
the initial recognition exception under 
Ind AS 12, so that it no longer applies 
to transactions that give rise to equal 
taxable 
and 
deductible 
temporary 
differences such as leases. There 
was no impact of the change on the 
financial statements.
	
	
Apart 
from 
these, 
consequential 
amendments and editorials have been 
made to other Ind AS like Ind AS 101, 
Ind AS 102, Ind AS 103, Ind AS 107, Ind 
AS 109, Ind AS 115 and Ind AS 34.
2.2	 Business Combination and Goodwill
	
Business combinations (other than those 
under common control) are accounted for 
using the acquisition method under Ind AS 
103. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date 
fair value. Acquisition-related costs are 
expensed as incurred.
	
At the acquisition date, the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
are recognised at their acquisition date fair 
values. However, the following assets and 
liabilities acquired in a business combination 
are measured at the basis indicated below: 
 
 
The assets or liabilities related to 
employee benefit arrangements are 
recognised and measured in accordance 
with Ind AS 19 Employee Benefits.
 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognized and measured in accordance 
with Ind AS 12 Income Taxes.
	
When the Group acquires a business, it 
assesses the financial assets and liabilities 
assumed for appropriate classification 
and designation in accordance with the 
Annual Report 
2024
308
Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 342
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
contractual terms, economic circumstances 
and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition 
date. The consideration transferred by the 
acquirer is recognized at fair value at the 
acquisition date. Deferred consideration is 
classified as a liability under Ind AS 109 and 
is measured at amortized cost.
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, 
being the excess of the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred over the net 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed. After initial recognition, goodwill 
is measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for 
impairment annually or more frequently 
if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that they might be impaired.
	
For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination 
is, from the acquisition date, allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating 
units that are expected to benefit from 
the combination, irrespective of whether 
other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are 
assigned to those units.
	
A cash generating unit to which goodwill 
has been allocated is tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is 
an indication that the unit may be impaired. 
If the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit is less than its carrying 
amount, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to 
the other assets of the unit pro rata based 
on the carrying amount of each asset in 
the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill 
is recognised in statement of profit or loss. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill 
is not reversed in subsequent periods.
2.3 Basis of consolidation
	
Subsidiaries are all entities (including 
structured entities) over which the Group 
has Control. The determination of control 
for the purpose of consolidation is done as 
per Ind AS 110. Control is achieved when the 
Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee.
	
Specifically, the Group controls an investee 
if and only if the Group has:
	
a)	 Power over the investee (i.e. existing 
rights that give it the current ability 
to 
direct 
the 
relevant 
activities 
of the investee)
	
b)	 Exposure, 
or 
rights, 
to 
variable 
returns from its involvement with 
the investee, and
	
c)	 The ability to use its power over the 
investee to affect its returns
	
Generally, there is a presumption that a 
majority of voting rights result in control. 
To support this presumption and when 
the Group has less than a majority of the 
voting or similar rights of an investee, the 
Group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has 
power over an investee, including:
	
a)	 The contractual arrangement with the 
other vote holders of the investee
	
b)	 Rights arising from other contractual  
arrangements
Annual Report  
2024
309
Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 343
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
c)	 The Group’s voting rights and potential  
voting rights
	
d)	 The size of the group’s holding of 
voting rights relative to the size and 
dispersion of the holdings of the other 
voting rights holders
	
The 
Group 
re-assesses 
whether 
or 
not it controls an investee if facts and 
circumstances indicate that there are 
changes to one or more of the three 
elements of control. Consolidation of a 
subsidiary begins when the Group obtains 
control over the subsidiary and ceases when 
the Group loses control of the subsidiary. 
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of 
a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during 
the year are included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements from the date the 
Group gains control until the date the Group 
ceases to control the subsidiary. 
	
Consolidated Financial Statements are 
prepared using uniform accounting policies 
for like transactions and other events in 
similar circumstances. If a member of 
the group uses accounting policies other 
than those adopted in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements for like transactions 
and 
events 
in 
similar 
circumstances, 
appropriate adjustments are made to that 
group 
member’s 
Financial 
Statements 
in preparing the Consolidated Financial 
Statements to ensure conformity with the 
group’s accounting policies.
	
The Financial Statements of all entities 
used for the purpose of consolidation are 
drawn up to same reporting date as that of 
the Group. When the end of the reporting 
period of the parent is different from that 
of a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, for 
consolidation purposes, additional financial 
information as of the same date as the 
consolidated financial statements of the 
parent to enable the parent to consolidate 
the financial information of the subsidiary, 
unless it is impracticable to do so.
	
Consolidation procedures:
	
(a)	 Combine like items of assets, liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows 
of the parent with those of its subsidiaries. 
For this purpose, income and expenses of 
the subsidiary are based on the amounts 
of the assets and liabilities recognised in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements at 
the acquisition date.
	
(b)	 Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount 
of the parent’s investment in each 
subsidiary and the parent’s portion of 
equity of each subsidiary. 
	
(c)	 Eliminate in full intragroup assets and 
liabilities, equity, income, expenses 
and cash flows relating to transactions 
between entities of the group (profits 
or losses resulting from intragroup 
transactions that are recognised in 
Fixed assets, such as inventory and 
fixed assets, are eliminated in full). 
Intragroup losses may indicate an 
impairment that requires recognition in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Ind AS12 Income Taxes applies to 
temporary differences that arise from 
the elimination of profits and losses 
resulting from intragroup transactions.
	
Profit or loss and each component of other 
comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed 
Annual Report

Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 344
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
to the equity holders of the parent of the 
Group and to the non-controlling interests, 
even if this results in the non-controlling 
interests having a deficit balance. When 
necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries to 
bring their accounting policies into line 
with the Group’s accounting policies. All 
intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows relating 
to transactions between members of the 
Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. 
The 
Group 
measures 
non-controlling 
interests at their proportion of the fair value 
of the identifiable net assets. 
2.4 Investment in associates and 
joint ventures
	
An associate is an entity over which the 
Group has significant influence. Significant 
influence is the power to participate 
in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the investee, but is not control 
or joint control.
	
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement 
whereby the parties that have joint control 
of the arrangement have rights to the net 
assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an 
arrangement, which exists only when decisions 
about the relevant activities require unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control.
	
The considerations made in determining 
whether significant influence is similar to 
those necessary to determine control over 
the  Subsidiaries.
	
The Group’s investments in its associate 
and joint venture are accounted for using 
the equity method. Under the equity 
method, the investment in an associate or 
a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. 
	
The carrying amount of the investment 
is adjusted to recognise changes in the 
Group’s share of net assets of the associate 
or joint venture since the acquisition date. 
Goodwill relating to the associate or joint 
venture is included in the carrying amount 
of the investment and is not tested for 
impairment individually.
	
The consolidated statement of profit and 
loss reflects the Group’s share of the results 
of operations of the associate or joint 
venture. Any change in OCI of the associate 
or joint venture is presented as part of the 
Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has 
been a change recognised directly in the 
equity of the associate or joint venture, 
the Group recognises its share of any 
changes, when applicable, in the statement 
of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and 
losses resulting from transactions between 
the Group and the associate or joint venture 
are eliminated to the extent of the interest 
in the associate or joint venture.
	
If an entity’s share of losses of an associate 
or joint venture equals or exceeds its 
interest in the associate or joint venture 
(which includes any long term interest that, 
in substance, form part of the Group’s net 
investment in the associate), the entity 
discontinues recognising its share of further 
losses. Additional losses are recognised 
only to the extent that the Group has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations or 
made payments on behalf of the associate 
or joint venture. If the associate or joint

2024

Financial Statements

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
venture subsequently reports profits, the 
entity resumes recognising its share of 
those profits only after its share of the profits 
equals the share of losses not recognised.
	
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit 
or loss of an associate and joint venture 
is shown on the face of the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss. The financial 
statements of the associate and joint venture 
are prepared for the same reporting period 
as the Group. When necessary, adjustments 
are made to bring the accounting policies in 
line with those of the Group. 
	
After application of the equity method, the 
Group determines whether it is necessary 
to recognise an impairment loss on its 
investment in its associate or joint venture. At 
each reporting date, the Group determines 
whether there is objective evidence that 
the investment in the associate or joint 
venture is impaired.
	
If there is such evidence, the Group 
calculates the amount of impairment as the 
difference between the recoverable amount 
of the associate or joint venture and its 
carrying value, and then recognises the loss 
as ‘exceptional items’ in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss.
	
Upon loss of significant influence over 
the associate, the Group measures and 
recognises any retained investment at 
its fair value. Any difference between the 
carrying amount of the associate upon loss 
of significant influence and the fair value of 
the retained investment and proceeds from 
disposal is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss.
2.5 Summary of material accounting 
policies
	
a.	
Current versus non-current classification
	
	
The 
Group 
presents 
assets 
and 
liabilities in the consolidated balance 
sheet based on current / non-current 
classification. 
	
	
An asset is classified as current when it 
is expected to be realised or intended to 
be sold or consumed in normal operating 
cycle, held primarily for the purpose of 
trading, expected to be realised within 
twelve months after the reporting 
period, or cash or cash equivalent unless 
restricted from being exchanged or used 
to settle a liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period. All 
other assets are classified as non-current.
	
	
A liability is classified as current when 
it is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle, it is held primarily 
for the purpose of trading, it is due 
to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or there 
is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting 
period. The Group classifies all other 
liabilities as non-current.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities, 
are classified as non-current assets 
and liabilities.
	
	
The operating cycle is the time between 
the acquisition of assets for processing 
and their realisation in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Group has identified 
twelve months as its operating cycle.

b.	
Foreign currencies
	
	
Functional and presentation currency
	
	
Items included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the Group 
are measured using the currency of 
the primary economic environment in 
which it operates i.e. the “functional 
currency”. The Group’s consolidated 
financial statements are presented 
in INR, which is also the Holding 
Company’s functional currency.
	
	
Transactions and balances
	
	
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
initially recorded by the Group’s entities 
at their respective functional currency 
at exchange rates prevailing at the 
date the transaction first qualifies 
for recognition.
	
	
Monetary 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the functional currency 
spot rates of exchange at the reporting 
date. Exchange differences arising on 
settlement or translation of monetary 
items are recognised in profit or loss.
	
	
Non-monetary items that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the dates of the 
initial transactions. 
	
	
Non-monetary items measured at fair 
value in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the date 
when the fair value is determined. 
The gain or loss arising on translation 
of non-monetary items measured at 
fair value is treated in line with the 
recognition of the gain or loss on the 
change in fair value of the item (i.e., 
translation differences on items whose 
fair value gain or loss is recognised in 
other comprehensive income (“OCI”) 
or consolidated statement of profit 
and loss, are also recognised in OCI or 
consolidated statement of profit and 
loss, respectively).
	
	
Group companies
	
	
On consolidation, the assets and 
liabilities of foreign operations are 
translated into INR at the rate of 
exchange prevailing at the reporting 
date and their consolidated statements 
of profit and loss are translated at 
exchange rates prevailing at the dates 
of the transactions. The exchange 
differences arising on translation for 
consolidation are recognised in OCI. 
On disposal of a foreign operation, 
the component of OCI relating to 
that particular foreign operation is 
recognised in profit or loss.
	
c.	
Fair value measurement
	
	
The Group measures certain financial 
instruments (e.g. investments) at fair 
value at each balance sheet date. 
	
	
Fair value is the price that would 
be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. 
	
	
The fair value measurement is based on 
the presumption that the transaction to 
sell the asset or transfer the liabilities 
takes place either in the principal 
Annual Report

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
market for the asset or liability or in 
absence of principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the 
asset or liability.
	
	
A fair value measurement of a non-
financial asset takes into account a 
market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to 
another market participant that would 
use the asset in its highest and best use.
	
	
The Group uses valuation techniques 
that 
are 
appropriate 
in 
the 
circumstances and for which sufficient 
data are available to measure fair 
value, maximising the use of relevant 
observable inputs and minimising the 
use of unobservable inputs.
	
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair 
value is measured or disclosed in the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, 
described 
as 
follows, 
based on the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
	
	
Level 1- Quoted (Unadjusted) marked 
prices in the active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities
	
	
Level 2- Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement is directly 
or indirectly observable
	
	
Level 3- Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant 
to 
the 
fair 
value 
measurement 
is unobservable.
	
	
For 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
that 
are 
recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements on a recurring basis, the 
Group determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy 
by re-assessing categorisation (based on 
the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) at 
the end of each reporting period.
	
	
At 
each 
reporting 
date, 
the 
management analyses the movements 
in the values of assets and liabilities 
which are required to be re-measured 
or re-assessed as per the Group’s 
accounting policies. For this analysis, 
the management or its expert verifies 
the major inputs applied in the latest 
valuation by agreeing the information in 
the valuation computation to contracts 
and other relevant documents.
	
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, 
the Group has determined classes of 
assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the 
asset or liability and the level of the fair 
value hierarchy as explained above.
	
d.	
Revenue recognition
	
	
Revenue is measured based on the 
consideration specified in a contract 
with a customer (transaction price) net 
of variable consideration e.g. discounts, 
volume rebates, any payments made to 
a customer (unless the payment is for a 
distinct good or service received from 
the customer) and excludes amounts 
collected on behalf of third parties. 
The Group recognises revenue when 
it transfers control over a product or 
Annual Report 
2024
314
Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 348
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
service to a customer. Revenue is only 
recognised to the extent that it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal 
will not occur.
	
	
The Group provides incentives to 
its users in various forms including 
cashbacks. 
Incentives 
which 
are 
consideration payable to the customer 
that are not in exchange for a 
distinct good or service are generally 
recognized as a reduction of revenue.
	
	
Where the Group acts as an agent 
for selling goods or services, only 
the commission income is included 
within revenue. The specific revenue 
recognition criteria described below 
must also be met before revenue is 
recognized. Typically, the Group has 
a right to payment before or at the 
point that services are delivered. 
Cash received before the services are 
delivered is recognised as a contract 
liability. The amount of consideration 
does not contain a significant financing 
component as payment terms are less 
than one year. 
	
	
Sale of services 
	
	
Revenue from services is recognized 
when 
the 
control 
in 
services 
is 
transferred as per the terms of the 
agreement with customer i.e. as and 
when services are rendered. Revenues 
are disclosed net of the Goods and 
Services Tax charged on such services. 
In terms of the contract, excess of 
revenue over the billed at the year-
end is carried in the balance sheet as 
trade receivables where the amount is 
recoverable from the customer without 
any 
future 
performance 
obligation 
and the Group has unconditional right 
over such consideration (i.e. if only 
the passage of time is required before 
payment of such consideration is due). 
Cash received before the services 
are delivered is recognised as a 
contract liability.
	
	
Commission
	
	
The Group facilitates recharge of 
talk time, bill payments, availability 
of bus tickets and sale of deal 
coupons and earns commission for 
the respective services. Commission 
income 
is 
recognized 
when 
the 
control in services is transferred to the 
customer when the services have been 
provided by the Group.
	
	
Service fees from merchants
	
	
The Group earns service fee from 
merchants and recognizes such revenue 
when the control in services have been 
transferred by the Group i.e. as and 
when services have been provided 
by the Group. Such service fee is 
generally determined as a percentage 
of transaction value executed by the 
merchants. Amount received by the 
Group pending settlement are disclosed 
as payable to the merchants under other 
financial liabilities.
	
	
Revenue from broking activities
	
	
Revenue 
from 
broking 
activities, 
fees and delayed payment charges 
is recognized on the trade date of 
transaction (net of Goods & service

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
tax (GST), securities transaction tax, 
stamp duties and other levies by SEBI 
and stock exchanges). Revenue from 
platform fees are received periodically 
but are recognized as earned on 
pro-rata basis over the term of the 
contract i.e. one year.
	
	
Government Grants
	
	
The Group recognises government 
grants only when there is reasonable 
assurance that the conditions attached 
to them will be complied with, and the 
grants will be received. Government 
grants 
related 
to 
revenue 
are 
recognized on a systematic basis in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss as other operating revenue over 
the periods necessary to match them 
with the related costs, if any, which 
they are intended to compensate.
	
	
Interest income
	
	
For all debt instruments measured either 
at amortised cost or at fair value through 
other comprehensive income, interest 
income is recorded using the effective 
interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that 
exactly discounts the estimated future 
cash payments or receipts over the 
expected life of the financial instrument 
or a shorter period, where appropriate, 
to the gross carrying amount of the 
financial asset or to the amortised cost 
of a financial liability. When calculating 
the effective interest rate, the Group 
estimates the expected cash flows by 
considering all the contractual terms of 
the financial instrument but does not 
consider the expected credit losses. 
Interest income is included in other 
income in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.
	
e.	
Trade receivable
	
	
Trade receivables are amounts due 
from customers for services performed 
in the ordinary course of business and 
reflects group’s unconditional right to 
consideration (that is, payment is due 
only on the passage of time). Trade 
receivables are recognised initially at the 
transaction price as they do not contain 
significant financing components. The 
group holds the trade receivables with 
the objective of collecting the contractual 
cash flows and therefore measures 
them subsequently at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, less 
loss allowance. 
	
f.	
Taxes
	
	
Current income tax
	
	
Current income tax assets and liabilities 
are measured at the amount expected to 
be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws 
used to compute the amount are those 
that are enacted or substantively enacted, 
at the reporting date in the countries 
where the Group operates and generates 
taxable income.
	
	
Current income tax relating to items 
recognised 
outside 
consolidated 
statement of profit and loss is recognised 
either in other comprehensive income 
or in equity. Current tax items are 
recognised 
in 
correlation 
to 
the 
underlying transaction either in OCI 
Annual Report 
2024
316
Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 350
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
or directly in equity. Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in 
the tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are 
subject to interpretation and considers 
whether it is probable that a taxation 
authority will accept an uncertain tax 
treatment. The Group measures its 
tax balances either based on the most 
likely amount or the expected value, 
depending on which method provides 
a better prediction of the resolution of 
the uncertainty.
	
	
Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred tax is provided using the liability 
method 
on 
temporary 
differences 
between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts 
for financial reporting purposes at the 
reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities 
are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences, except:
 
 
When the deferred tax liability 
arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of 
the transaction, affects neither 
the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss.
 
 
In respect of taxable temporary 
differences 
associated 
with 
investments 
in 
subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint 
ventures, when the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and 
it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for 
all deductible temporary differences, 
the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry 
forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses can be utilised, The 
carrying amount of deferred tax assets 
is reviewed at each reporting date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit 
will be available to allow all or part of 
the deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are 
re-assessed at each reporting date and 
are recognised to the extent that it has 
become probable that future taxable 
profits will allow the deferred tax asset 
to be recovered.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are not recognised 
for temporary differences between 
the carrying amount and tax bases of 
investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and interest in joint arrangements where 
it is not probable that the differences 
will reverse in the foreseeable future 
and taxable profit will not be available 
against which the temporary difference 
can be utilised.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the year when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled,

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised 
outside consolidated statement of profit 
and loss is recognised either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity. 
Deferred tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction 
either in OCI or directly in equity.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred 
tax liabilities are offset if a legally 
enforceable right exists to set off 
current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and the deferred taxes relate 
to the same taxable entity and the 
same taxation authority.
	
	
Taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on 
incurring expenses
	
	
Assets are recognised net of the 
amount of GST paid, except when the 
tax incurred on a purchase of assets 
is not recoverable from the taxation 
authority, in which case, the tax paid 
is recognised as part of the cost of 
acquisition of the asset.
	
	
Expenses are recognised net of the 
amount of GST paid, except when the tax 
incurred on a purchase of services is not 
recoverable from the taxation authority, 
in which case, the tax paid is expensed 
off in statement of profit and loss.
	
	
The net amount of tax recoverable from, 
or payable to, the taxation authority is 
included as part of other current/ non- 
current assets or other current liabilities 
in the consolidated balance sheet.
	
g.	
Property, plant and equipment
	
	
Property, plant and equipment are 
carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment, if any. Property, plant and 
equipment is depreciated on a written 
down value basis to its residual value 
over its estimated useful life.
	
	
Cost directly attributable to acquisition 
are capitalised until the property, plant 
and equipment are ready for use, as 
intended by the management. 
	
	
Subsequent costs are capitalised on 
the carrying amount or recognised 
as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when future economic benefits 
associated with the item are probable 
to flow to the Group and cost of the 
item can be measured reliably. When 
significant parts of property, plant and 
equipment are required to be replaced 
at intervals, the Group depreciates 
them separately based on their specific 
useful lives. The carrying amount of 
any component accounted for as a 
separate asset is derecognised when 
replaced. All repair and maintenance 
are charged to consolidated statement 
of profit and loss during the reporting 
period in which they are incurred.
	
	
Advances paid towards the acquisition 
of property, plant and equipment 
outstanding at each balance sheet 
date is classified as capital advances 
under the non-current assets and the 
cost of assets not ready to use before 
such date are disclosed under ‘Capital 
work in progress’.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or 
retirement of an item of property, plant 
and equipment is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset 
and is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss on the date 
of disposal or retirement.
	
	
Depreciation is provided using the 
written down value method except for 
plant and machinery on which straight 
line method is used, based on technical 
evaluation done by the management 
and charged to consolidated statement 
of profit and loss as per the useful life 
prescribed under schedule II of the 
Companies Act, 2013, given below:
Assets
Useful life  
(in years)
Servers and networking 
equipment (Computers)
6
Laptops and desktops 
(Computers)
3
Office equipment
5
Furniture and fittings
10
Vehicles

Plant & Machinery
-	 EDC/POS machines

-	 Soundbox
2
	
	
Leasehold 
improvements 
are 
depreciated over the shorter of their 
useful life or the lease term, unless the 
entity expects to use the assets beyond 
the lease term.
	
	
During the previous year, the Holding 
Company had changed the method of 
depreciation for Plant & Machinery from 
written down value method to straight 
line method along with change in life to 3 
years and 2 years for EDC/POS machines 
and Soundbox, respectively and the 
impact on account of such change in 
estimate was assessed to be immaterial 
for the current and future periods.
	
	
The residual values, useful lives and 
methods of depreciation of property, 
plant and equipment are reviewed at 
each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
	
h.	
Intangible assets
	
	
Separately acquired intangible assets, 
such as software are measured initially 
at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost 
less 
accumulated 
amortization 
and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Costs 
associated 
with 
maintaining 
software programmes are recognised as 
an expense as incurred. Development 
costs that are directly attributable to the 
design and testing of identifiable and 
unique software products controlled by 
the Group are recognised as intangible 
assets where the following criteria are met:
 
 
it is technically feasible to complete 
the software so that it will be 
available for use or sale
 
 
management intends to complete 
the software and use or sell it
 
 
there is an ability to use or 
sell the software
 
 
it can be demonstrated how the 
software will generate probable 
future economic benefits

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
 
 
adequate technical, financial and 
other resources to complete the 
development and to use or sell the 
software are available, and
 
 
the expenditure attributable to the 
software during its development 
can be reliably measured.
	
	
Directly attributable costs that are 
capitalised as part of the software 
include employee costs.
	
	
Research and development costs
	
	
Research expenditure and development 
expenditure that do not meet the 
criteria above are recognised as an 
expense as incurred. Development 
costs previously recognised as an 
expense are not recognised as an asset 
in a subsequent period.
	
	
Amortization methods and periods
	
	
Amortization of intangible assets begins 
when development is complete and 
the asset is available for use. Software, 
licenses 
acquired 
and 
internally 
generated software are amortized at 
the rate of 40% per annum on written 
down value method. During the period 
of development, the asset is tested for 
impairment annually. The amortization 
period and the amortization method are 
reviewed at least at each financial year 
end. Changes in the expected useful life 
or the expected pattern of consumption 
of future economic benefits embodied 
in the asset are considered to modify 
the amortization period or method, as 
appropriate, and are treated as changes 
in accounting estimates. The amortization 
expense 
on 
intangible 
assets 
is 
recognized in the statement of profit and 
loss unless such expenditure forms part 
of carrying value of another asset.
	
	
Gains or losses arising from de-
recognition of an intangible asset are 
measured as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and are recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss when 
the asset is derecognized.
	
i.	
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
	
For all non-financial assets, the Group 
assesses whether there are indicators 
of impairment. If such an indicator exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss, if any. Where the 
asset does not generate cash flows that 
are independent from other assets, the 
Group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to 
which the asset belongs. 
	
	
The recoverable amount for an asset or 
CGU is the higher of its value in use and 
fair value less costs of disposal. If the 
recoverable amount of an asset or CGU 
is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount or CGU the asset is considered 
impaired and the carrying amount 
of the asset or CGU is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss 
is 
recognised 
immediately 
in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss. 
	
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows of the asset or CGU are 
Annual Report 
2024
320
Financial Statements

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset. In determining fair value 
less costs of disposal, recent market 
transactions are taken into account. If 
no such transactions can be identified, 
an appropriate valuation model is used. 
These calculations are corroborated by 
valuation multiples, quoted share prices 
for publicly traded companies or other 
available fair value indicators.
	
	
The 
Group 
bases 
its 
impairment 
calculation on detailed budgets and 
forecast calculations. These budgets 
and forecast calculations generally 
cover a period of five years. For longer 
periods, a long-term growth rate is 
calculated and applied to project 
future cash flows after the fifth year. 
To estimate cash flow projections 
beyond periods covered by the most 
recent budgets/forecasts, the Group 
extrapolates cash flow projections in 
the budget using a steady or declining 
growth rate for subsequent years, 
unless an increasing rate can be 
justified. In any case, this growth rate 
does not exceed the long-term average 
growth rate for the products, industries, 
or country or countries in which the 
entity operates, or for the market in 
which the asset is used.
	
	
An assessment is made at each 
reporting date to determine whether 
there is an indication that previously 
recognised 
impairment 
losses 
no 
longer exist or have decreased. If such 
indication exists, the Group estimates 
the 
asset’s 
or 
CGU’s 
recoverable 
amount. 
A 
previously 
recognised 
impairment loss is reversed only if there 
has been a change in the assumptions 
used to determine the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount since the last 
impairment loss was recognised. The 
reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed 
its recoverable amount, nor exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had 
no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset in prior years. Such reversal 
is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss. 
	
j.	
Provisions and contingencies
	
	
Provisions
	
	
Provisions are recognised when the 
Group has a present obligation (legal 
or constructive) as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. 
When the Group expects some or 
all of a provision to be reimbursed, 
the reimbursement is recognised as 
a separate asset, but only when the 
reimbursement 
is 
virtually 
certain. 
The expense relating to a provision 
is 
presented 
in 
the 
consolidated 
statement of profit and loss net of any 
reimbursement. If the effect of the time 
value of money is material, provisions 
are discounted using a current pre-tax 
rate that reflects, when appropriate,

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
the risks specific to the liability. When 
discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a finance cost.
	
	
Contingencies
	
	
A contingent liability is a possible 
obligation that arises from past events 
whose existence will be confirmed by 
the occurrence or non-occurrence of 
one or more uncertain future events 
beyond the control of the Group or a 
present obligation that is not recognized 
because it is not probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation. A contingent 
liability also arises in extremely rare 
cases where there is a liability that 
cannot be recognized because it cannot 
be measured reliably. The Group does 
not recognize a contingent liability 
but discloses its existence in the 
consolidated financial Statements.
	
k.	
Retirement and other employee benefits
	
	
For defined benefit plans (gratuity), 
the liability or asset recognised in the 
balance sheet is the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation at the end of 
the reporting period less the fair value 
of plan assets. The defined benefit 
obligation is calculated by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. 
	
	
The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows by 
reference to market yields at the end 
of the reporting period on government 
bonds that have terms approximating 
to the terms of the related obligation.
	
	
The net interest cost is calculated by 
applying the discount rate to the net 
balance of the defined benefit obligation 
and the fair value of plan assets. This 
cost is included in employee benefit 
expense in the consolidated statement 
of profit and loss.
	
	
Remeasurement gains and losses arising 
from 
experience 
adjustments 
and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are 
recognised in the period in which they 
occur, directly in other comprehensive 
income. They are included in retained 
earnings in the statement of changes 
in equity and in the balance sheet. Re-
measurements are not reclassified to 
profit or loss in subsequent periods.
	
	
Changes in the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation resulting 
from plan amendments or curtailments 
are recognised immediately in profit or 
loss as past service cost.
	
	
The Group’s contributions to defined 
contribution plans (provident fund) 
are recognized in profit or loss when 
the employee renders related service. 
The Group has no further obligations 
under 
these 
plans 
beyond 
its 
periodic contributions.
	
	
The Group provides for liability at year 
end on account of un-availed earned 
leave and Long Term Incentive Plan 
(‘LTIP’) as per actuarial valuation using 
projected unit credit method.

Liabilities for wages and salaries, 
including non-monetary benefits that 
are expected to be settled wholly within 
12 months after the end of the period in 
which the employees render the related 
service are recognised in respect of 
employees' services up to the end of the 
reporting period and are measured at 
the amounts expected to be paid when 
the liabilities are settled. The liabilities 
are presented as employee benefit 
payable under other financial liabilities 
in the consolidated balance sheet.
	
	
The 
Code 
on 
Social 
Security, 
2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee 
benefits 
during 
employment 
and 
post-employment 
benefits 
received 
Presidential assent in September 2020. 
The Code has been published in the 
Gazette of India. Certain sections of the 
Code came into effect on May 03, 2023. 
However, the final rules/interpretation 
have not yet been issued. Based on 
a preliminary assessment, the entity 
believes the impact of the change will 
not be significant.
	
l.	
Share-based payments
	
	
Equity-settled transactions
	
	
Employees (including senior executives) 
of the Group receive remuneration in 
the form of share-based payments, 
whereby employees render services 
as consideration for equity instruments 
(equity-settled transactions).
	
	
The cost of equity-settled transactions 
is determined by the fair value at the 
date when the grant is made using an 
appropriate valuation model.
	
	
That cost is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in 
Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) 
reserves in equity, over the period in 
which the performance and/or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee 
benefits 
expense. 
The 
cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date 
until the vesting date reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Group’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The consolidated 
statement of profit and loss expense 
or credit for a period represents the 
movement 
in 
cumulative 
expense 
recognised as at the beginning and 
end of that period and is recognised in 
employee benefits expense.
	
	
Performance 
conditions 
which 
are 
market conditions are taken into account 
when determining the grant date fair 
value of the awards. Service and non-
market performance conditions are not 
taken into account when determining 
the grant date fair value of awards, but 
the likelihood of the conditions being 
met is assessed as part of the Group’s 
best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest.
	
	
No expense is recognised for awards 
that do not ultimately vest because 
non-market 
performance 
and/or 
service conditions have not been met.
	
	
When the terms of an equity-settled 
award are modified, the minimum expense 
recognised is the expense had the terms

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
not been modified, if the original terms of 
the award are met. An additional expense 
is recognised for any modification that 
increases the total fair value of the 
share-based payment transaction, or is 
otherwise beneficial to the employee as 
measured at the date of modification. 
	
	
Where an award is cancelled by the 
entity or by the counterparty, any 
remaining element of the fair value of 
the award is expensed immediately 
through profit or loss.
	
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding 
options is reflected as additional share 
dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
	
m.	 Financial instruments
	
	
A financial instrument is any contract 
that gives rise to a financial asset of 
one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.
	
	
Financial assets
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
All financial assets are recognised 
initially at fair value plus, in the case of 
financial assets not recorded at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs 
that are attributable to the acquisition 
of the financial asset. However, trade 
receivables that do not contain a 
significant financing component are 
measured at transaction price.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
For 
purposes 
of 
subsequent 
measurement, 
financial 
assets 
are 
classified in four categories:
 
 
Debt instruments at amortized cost
 
 
Debt instruments at fair value 
through 
other 
comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI)
 
 
Debt instruments, derivatives and 
equity instruments at fair value 
through profit or loss (FVTPL)
 
 
Equity instruments measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI)
	
	
Debt instruments at amortised cost
	
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the 
amortised cost if both the following 
conditions are met:
	
	
a)	 The asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold 
assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
	
	
b)	 Contractual terms of the asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial 
assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised 
cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral 
part of the EIR. The EIR amortization 
is included in finance income in the 
profit or loss. The losses arising from 
impairment are recognised in the profit 
or loss. This category generally applies 
Annual Report 
2024
324
Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 358
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
to trade and other receivables and is 
most relevant to the Group.
	
	
Debt instrument at FVTOCI
	
	
A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at 
the FVTOCI if both of the following 
criteria are met:
	
	
a)	 The objective of the business model 
is achieved both by collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling 
the financial assets, and
	
	
b)	 The asset’s contractual cash flows 
represent SPPI.
	
	
Debt instruments included within the 
FVTOCI category are measured initially 
as well as at each reporting date at 
fair value. Fair value movements are 
recognized in the other comprehensive 
income (OCI). However, the Group 
recognizes 
interest 
income, 
impairment losses and reversals and 
foreign exchange gain or loss in the 
consolidated statement of profit and 
loss. On derecognition of the asset, 
cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in OCI is reclassified from 
the equity to consolidated statement 
of profit and loss. Interest earned 
whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument 
is reported as interest income using 
the EIR method.
	
	
Debt instrument at FVTPL
	
	
FVTPL is a residual category for debt 
instruments. 
Any 
debt 
instrument, 
which does not meet the criteria for 
categorization as at amortized cost or 
as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
	
	
In addition, the Group may elect to 
designate a debt instrument, which 
otherwise meets amortized cost or 
FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, 
such election is allowed only if doing so 
reduces or eliminates a measurement 
or recognition inconsistency (referred 
to as ‘accounting mismatch’). 
	
	
Debt instruments included within the 
FVTPL category are measured at fair 
value with all changes recognized 
in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
Equity investments
	
	
All equity investments in scope of Ind 
AS 109 are measured at fair value. The 
Group may make an irrevocable election 
to present in other comprehensive 
income subsequent changes in the fair 
value. The Group makes such election 
on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
The classification is made on initial 
recognition and is irrevocable.
	
	
If the Group decides to classify an equity 
instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value 
changes on the instrument, excluding 
dividends, are recognized in the OCI. 
There is no recycling of the amounts 
from OCI to consolidated statement of 
profit or loss, even on sale of investment. 
However, the Group may transfer the 
cumulative gain or loss within equity.
	
	
Equity instruments included within 
the FVTPL category are measured at 
fair value with all changes recognized 
in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
The equity securities which are not held 
for trading, and for which the Group has 
made an irrevocable election at initial 
recognition to recognize changes in fair 
value through OCI rather than profit or 
loss as these are strategic investments 
and the Group considered this to 
be more relevant.
	
	
Equity investments in associates and 
joint ventures are measured at cost. 
The investments are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment 
considering the provisions of Ind AS 
36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. If any such 
indication exists, policy for impairment 
of non-financial assets is followed.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, 
a part of a financial asset or part of a 
group of similar financial assets) is 
primarily derecognised (i.e. removed 
from 
the 
Group’s 
consolidated 
balance sheet) when:
 
 
The rights to receive cash flows 
from the asset have expired, or
 
 
The Group has transferred its 
rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash 
flows in full without material delay 
to a third party under a ‘pass-
through’ arrangement; and either 
(a) the Group has transferred 
substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or (b) the 
Group has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
	
	
When the Group has transferred its 
rights to receive cash flows from an 
asset or has entered into a pass-
through arrangement, it evaluates if 
and to what extent it has retained the 
risks and rewards of ownership. When 
it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of the asset, nor transferred control 
of the asset, the Group continues to 
recognise the transferred asset to 
the extent of the Group’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Group also 
recognises an associated liability. The 
transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that 
the Group has retained.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the 
Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) 
model for measurement and recognition 
of impairment loss on financial assets 
that are debt instruments, and are 
measured at amortised cost e.g., 
loans, debt securities, deposits, trade 
receivables and bank balance.
	
	
The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ 
for recognition of impairment loss 
allowance on trade receivables. The 
application of simplified approach does 
not require the Group to track changes 
in credit risk. Rather, it recognises 
impairment loss allowance based on 
lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, 
right from its initial recognition.

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
For recognition of impairment loss 
on other financial assets and risk 
exposure, the Group determines that 
whether there has been a significant 
increase in the credit risk since initial 
recognition. If credit risk has not 
increased 
significantly, 
12-month 
expected credit loss (ECL) is used to 
provide for impairment loss. However, 
if credit risk has increased significantly, 
lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent 
period, credit quality of the instrument 
improves such that there is no longer 
a significant increase in credit risk 
since initial recognition, then the entity 
reverts to recognising impairment loss 
allowance based on 12-month ECL.
	
	
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit 
losses resulting from all possible 
default events over the expected life 
of a financial instrument. The 12-month 
ECL is a portion of the lifetime ECL 
which results from default events that 
are possible within 12 months after the 
reporting date.
	
	
ECL is the difference between all 
contractual cash flows that are due 
to the Group in accordance with the 
contract and all the cash flows that 
the entity expects to receive (i.e., 
all cash shortfalls), discounted at 
the original EIR.
	
	
The Group uses a provision matrix to 
determine impairment loss allowance 
on portfolio of its trade receivables. 
The provision matrix is based on its 
historically observed default rates over 
the expected life of the trade receivables 
and is adjusted for forward-looking 
estimates. At every reporting date, the 
historical observed default rates are 
updated and changes in the forward-
looking estimates are analysed.
	
	
ECL impairment loss allowance (or 
reversal) recognized during the period 
is recognized as income/ expense in 
the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss. This amount is reflected 
under the head other expenses in the 
consolidated statement of profit and 
loss. For the financial assets measured 
as at amortised cost ECL is presented 
as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part 
of the measurement of those assets in 
the consolidated balance sheet. The 
allowance reduces the net carrying 
amount. Until the asset meets write-
off criteria, the Group does not reduce 
impairment allowance from the gross 
carrying amount.
	
	
Financial liabilities
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at 
initial recognition, as financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings, payables, or 
as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, 
as appropriate.
	
	
All financial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value and, in the 
case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
	
	
The Group’s financial liabilities include 
borrowings, lease liabilities, trade and 
other payables.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities 
depends on their classification as 
described below: 
	
	
Loans and borrowings
	
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using 
the EIR method. Gains and losses are 
recognised in profit or loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through the EIR amortisation process. 
	
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included as finance 
costs in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised 
when the obligation under the liability 
is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is 
replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, 
or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an 
exchange or modification is treated 
as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new 
liability. The difference in the respective 
carrying amounts is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities 
are offset and the net amount is reported 
in the consolidated balance sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal 
right to offset the recognised amounts 
and there is an intention to settle on 
a net basis, to realise the assets and 
settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	
n.	
Cash and cash equivalents
	
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the 
consolidated balance sheet comprise 
cash at banks and on hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less, which are 
subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
	
	
For the purpose of the consolidated 
statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and short-
term deposits, as defined above, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts as they are 
considered an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management.
	
o.	
Leases
	
	
The Group as a lessee
	
	
The 
Group’s 
lease 
asset 
classes 
primarily consist of leases for land and 
office premises. The Group assesses 
whether a contract contains a lease, 
at inception of a contract. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration. To assess 
whether a contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset, 
Annual Report 
2024

Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 362
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
the Group assesses whether: (i) the 
contact involves the use of an identified 
asset (ii) the Group has substantially 
all of the economic benefits from use 
of the asset through the period of the 
lease and (iii) the Group has the right to 
direct the use of the asset.
	
	
At the date of commencement of the 
lease, the Group recognizes a right-of-
use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding 
lease liability for all lease arrangements 
in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less 
(short-term leases) and low value 
leases. For these short-term and low 
value leases, the Group recognizes 
the lease payments as an operating 
expense on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease.
	
	
Certain lease arrangements includes 
the options to extend or terminate the 
lease before the end of the lease term. 
ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably 
certain that they will be exercised.
	
	
The right-of-use assets are initially 
recognized at cost, which comprises 
the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made 
at or prior to the commencement 
date of the lease plus any initial direct 
costs less any lease incentives. They 
are subsequently measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any.
	
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated 
from the commencement date on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of 
the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. Right of use assets are 
evaluated for recoverability whenever 
events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amounts may 
not be recoverable. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, the recoverable 
amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value 
less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is 
determined on an individual asset basis 
unless the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are largely independent of 
those from other assets. In such cases, 
the recoverable amount is determined 
for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to 
which the asset belongs.
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured 
at amortized cost at the present value 
of the future lease payments. The 
lease payments are discounted using 
the interest rate implicit in the lease 
or, if not readily determinable, using 
the incremental borrowing rates in the 
country of domicile of these leases. 
Lease liabilities are remeasured with 
a corresponding adjustment to the 
related right of use asset if the Group 
changes its assessment if whether 
it will exercise an extension or a 
termination option.
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have 
been separately presented in the 
consolidated balance sheet and lease 
payments have been classified as 
financing cash flows.
	
p.	
Earnings/ (loss) per share (EPS)
	
	
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by 
dividing the profit/ (loss) for the year 
Annual Report

Financial Statements

File: annual_report_url, Page number: 363
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
attributable to equity holders of Holding 
Company by the weighted average 
number of Equity shares outstanding 
during the year.
	
	
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by 
dividing the profit/ (loss) attributable to 
equity holders of Holding Company by 
the weighted average number of Equity 
shares outstanding during the year 
plus the weighted average number of 
Equity shares that would be issued on 
conversion of all the dilutive potential 
Equity shares into Equity shares.
	
q.	
Segment reporting
	
	
Operating segments are reported in 
a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The Chief Operating 
decision-maker 
is 
responsible 
for 
allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments 
and makes strategic decisions.
	
r.	
Use of estimates 
	
	
The Group is required to make estimates 
and 
assumptions 
that 
affect 
the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
disclosure of contingent liabilities at 
the date of the consolidated financial 
statements and the reported amounts 
of revenue and expenses during the 
reporting period. Actual results could 
differ 
from 
those 
estimates. 
The 
Group bases its estimates on historical 
experience 
and 
on 
various 
other 
assumptions that are believed to be 
reasonable, the results of which form 
the basis for making judgements about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities.
	
s.	
Exceptional Items
	
	
On certain occasions, the size, type 
or incidence of an item of income or 
expense, pertaining to the ordinary 
activities of the Group is such that its 
disclosure improves the understanding 
of the performance of the Group. Such 
income or expense is classified as 
an exceptional item and accordingly 
disclosed in the consolidated financial 
statements. Significant impact on the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
arising from impairment and non-
recurring events are considered and 
reported as exceptional items.

3 (b). Leases (Contd..)
	
The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Group becomes 
obliged to exercise (or not exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty is only revised if a 
significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs, which affects this assessment, and 
that is within the control of the lessee. The Group has given notice to vacate certain office premises. 
This has been accounted as lease termination. Hence, in accordance with Ind AS 116, Lease Liability 
has been re-measured by INR 204 (March 31, 2023: 9) with corresponding adjustment to Right of 
use assets amounting to INR 185 (March 31, 2023: 24) and the remaining balance has been included 
in Miscellaneous Income disclosed under Other Income in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
The total cash outflow for leases for the year is INR 519 (March 31, 2023: 638)
	
Extension and termination options:
	
Extension and termination options are included in certain leases. These are used to maximise 
operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s operations. In certain 
cases, the extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by 
the respective lessor.

As at March 31, 2024, the Holding Company had balances recoverable of INR 139 from Go Airlines 
(India) Limited (“Go Air”) towards business related advances given and other dues. After considering 
recoveries and adjustments in the normal course of business during the year, the recoverable 
balance stands at INR 57 as on date. On May 10, 2023, the National Company Law Tribunal, Delhi 
Bench (‘NCLT’) admitted Go Air’s application for voluntary insolvency proceedings under the 
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016, and NCLT has also appointed an Insolvency Resolution 
Professional (IRP) to revive the airline and manage its operations. As at date, the sale of tickets has 
been suspended and flights are yet to resume for Go Air. As part of the claims process, on May 24, 
2023, the Holding Company has filed a claim with the IRP for recovery of outstanding balances. 
Pending outcome of the insolvency proceedings, the management has provided for the balance 
INR 57 as exceptional item in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
21. Earnings per shares (EPS)
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity 
holders of the Holding Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) attributable to equity holders of the 
Holding Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year 
plus the weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued on conversion of all the 
dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
22. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, 
assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next 12 months, are described below.
Deferred taxes and Income taxes
Deferred tax assets can be recognised for deductible temporary differences (including unused tax 
losses) only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary difference can be utilized. Most of the companies forming part of the Group are 
yet to generate operating profits, Management has assessed that as at March 31, 2024 it is not probable 
that such deferred tax assets can be realised in excess of available taxable temporary differences. 
Management re-assesses unrecognized deferred tax assets at each reporting date and recognizes to 
the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be 
recovered. For details about deferred tax assets, refer note 28.
During FY 2019-20 (AY 2020-21) a shareholder of the Holding Company holding 30.33% of shares 
of the Holding Company had transferred its shareholding to its group company (both entities being 
100% subsidiaries of the same ultimate parent entity). Based on advice from the Holding Company's tax 
experts, Management has assessed that a mere change in shareholding within the same group will not 
be an affirmative position to say that the shareholding has been changed. Further, since the shares of 
the Holding Company carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power were beneficially held 
by persons, i.e. ultimate holding company of the aforesaid entities, who beneficially held shares of the 
Holding Company carrying not less than fifty-one percent of the voting power on the last day of the year 
or years in which the loss was incurred, the Holding Company shall be entitled to carry forward and set 
off these losses against the taxable income of future years in accordance with the provisions of Section 
79 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. (refer note 28)
Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits) 
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are 
determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that 
may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, 
future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its 
long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All 
assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated, the management considers the interest rates of 
government bonds. The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. The mortality tables tend 
to change only at interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases 
are based on expected future inflation rates. For further details about gratuity obligations, refer note 27.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance 
sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured 
using valuation techniques including the DCF model, Price of Recent Investment (PORI) method and 
Comparable Company Multiples (CCM) method. The inputs to these models are taken from observable 
markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing 
fair values. For further details about Fair value measurement, refer note 31.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit risks associated with its assets 
carried at amortized cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk. Note 32 details how the Group determines whether there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk.
Impairment reviews
Goodwill and investments in associates and joint venture are tested for impairment at-least on an annual 
basis or when events that occur / changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of 
the CGU is less than its carrying value. In calculating the value in use, the Group is required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions inter-alia concerning the growth in EBITDA, long-term growth 
rates; discount rates to reflect the risks involved. Also, judgement is involved in determining the CGU for 
allocation of the goodwill.  For details about impairment reviews, refer note 36.
The Holding Company has investment in PPBL, an associate. During the year, given certain developments, 
the Company has recorded impairment of 100% carrying value. A qualitative assessment requires 
significant judgement (refer note 45)
Incentives
The Group provide incentives to users in various forms including cashbacks to promote its platform. 
Incentives to  users to whom the Group has a performance obligation is recorded as a reduction of 
revenue to the extent of the revenue earned. For the incentives to other transacting users to whom the 
Group has no performance obligation, management is required to determine whether the incentives are 
in substance a payment on behalf of the merchants and should therefore be recorded as a reduction of 
revenue or as marketing and promotional expenses. Some of the factors considered in management’s 
evaluation of such incentives being payments on behalf of  merchants include whether the incentives 
are given at the Group’s discretion, contractual agreements with the merchants, business strategy and 
objectives and design of the incentive program(s), etc.
Share-based payments
Employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share based payment instruments, whereby 
employees render services to group and receive equity instrument of Holding Company as consideration 
(equity-settled transactions). In accordance with the Ind AS 102 Share Based Payments, the cost of equity-
settled transactions is measured using the fair value method. The cumulative expense recognized for equity-
settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and the company's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.

contribute in excess of their contribution.

(formerly known as Paytm First Games Private Limited) even if it holds more than half of the voting rights of 
the investee entity. As per management’s judgement and evaluation,  the Group doesn’t have unilateral ability 
to direct the relevant activities.  The Group and other investor has ability to jointly direct the relevant activities 
of the investee entity by virtue of shareholder’s agreement and hence considered to be a joint venture.

A quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant assumption as at March 31, 2023 is 
as shown below:
	
The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates 
the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions 
occurring at the end of the reporting period. The methods and types of assumptions used in 
preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior year.
	
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the period ending March 31, 
2025 are INR 1064 (March 31, 2024 - INR 254).
	
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 4 years (March 31, 
2023- 2.79 years). 
	
The average remaining working life of members of the defined benefit obligation as at March 
31, 2024 is 30.67 years (as at March 31, 2023- 30.87 years)
	
The expected maturity analysis of  gratuity is as follows:

Risk exposure
	
Through its defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant 
of which are detailed below:
	
Asset volatility: The plan assets are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to 
bond yields. If plan assets underperform this yield, there will be a deficit of the plan asset 
investments in fixed income securities with high grades and in government securities. These 
are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk to an acceptable level.
	
Changes in bond yields: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based 
on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
	
Inflation risks: The payments are not linked to inflation, so this is a less material risk.

Life expectancy: Obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in 
life expectancy and inflation will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. This is particularly 
significant where inflationary conditions result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.

32. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk 
and liquidity risk. The Group continues to focus on a system-based approach to business risk 
management. The Group’s financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, 
evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business. Backed by strong internal 
control systems, the current Risk Management Framework rests on policies and procedures issued 
by appropriate authorities; process of regular internal reviews/audits to set appropriate risk limits 
and controls; monitoring of such risks and compliance confirmation for the same. 
a.	 Market Risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will 
fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market prices comprise three types of risk: 
interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and price risk. The Group has in place appropriate risk 
management policies to limit the impact of these risks on its financial performance. The Group 
ensures optimization of cash through fund planning and robust cash management practices.
	
(i)	 Interest Rate Risk
	
	
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial 
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
	
	
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the 
Group’s borrowings with floating interest rates.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
32. Financial risk management objectives and policies (Contd..)
	
	
There is no interest rate risk as the Group did not have borrowings at the end of the 
current financial year. The interest rate risk as at end of financial year is not material and 
thus not disclosed
	
	
Other financial assets and liabilities of the Group are either non-interest bearing or 
fixed interest bearing instruments, the Group’s net exposure to interest risk on such 
instruments is negligible.
	
(ii)	 Price risk
	
	
The Group invests its surplus funds in debt based mutual fund, fixed deposits, Commercial 
papers, Treasury bills, Government Securities, Certificate of deposits and non-convertible 
debentures. As on March 31, 2024, mutual fund investments were in debt based funds only.
	
	
Mutual fund investments are susceptible to market price risk, mainly arising from 
changes in the interest rates or market yields which may impact the return and value of 
such investments.
	
	
Set out below is the impact of a 0.25% movement in the NAV of mutual funds and debt 
instruments on the Group’s loss before tax:

March 31, 2023

The Group is also exposed to equity/ preference shares price risk arising from investments 
held by the Group and classified in the balance sheet either as fair value through OCI 
or at fair value through profit or loss (refer note 6(a) and 6(b)). To manage its price risk 
arising from investments in equity/preference shares, the Group diversifies its portfolio. 
Diversification of the portfolio is done in accordance with the limits set by the Group.
	
(iii)	Foreign currency risk
	
	
The Indian Rupee is the Group’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the Group’s 
results are presented in Indian Rupee and exposures are managed against Indian Rupee 
accordingly. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of 
an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s 
exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s 
operating activities and investing activities (when revenue, expense and Property, Plant 
and Equipment is denominated in a foreign currency).

The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity of profit or loss to a reasonably possible 
change in USD exchange rates, with all other variables held constant. The Group’s exposure 
to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

The above sensitivity analysis is based on a reasonably possible change in the under-
lying foreign currency against the functional currency while assuming all other variables 
to be constant.
	
	
Based on the movements in the foreign exchange rates historically and the prevailing 
market conditions as at the reporting date, the Group’s management has concluded that 
the above mentioned rates used for sensitivity are reasonable benchmarks.
	
	
*Amount below rounding off norms adopted by the Group
b.	 Credit Risk
	
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument 
or contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating 
activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its investing activities, including deposits with 
banks. Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored 
on an ongoing basis. The Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model on financial assets 
measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank 
balance. Cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirement of Ind AS 
109, the identified impairment loss was immaterial.
	
All of the Group investments and loans at amortised cost are considered to have low credit 
risk, and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 months 
expected losses. Management considers instruments to be low credit risk when they have 
a low risk of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow 
obligations in the near term.

(ii)	 Other investments (excluding loans to related parties)
	
	
All of the Group’s other investments (preference shares, government securities, commercial 
papers, treasury bills and security deposits) at amortised cost are considered to have low 
credit risk, and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12 
months’ expected losses. Management consider ‘low credit risk’ for listed instruments to be 
an investment grade credit rating with at least one major rating agency. Other instruments 
are considered to have low credit risk when they have a low risk of default and the issuer 
has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.
	
(iii)	Loan to related parties
	
	
The group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of loan and whether 
there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each 
reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the group 
compares the risk of a default occurring on the loan as at the reporting date with the risk of 
default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and supportive 
forwarding-looking information.
	
(iv)	Other financial assets
	
	
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s 
treasury department in accordance with the Group’s policy. Investment of surplus funds is 
made only with banks of high repute.
	
	
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet 
at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is the carrying amounts as illustrated in Note 
6 (c) and 6 (d).

34. Segment Reporting
The Group is engaged in different business units, including payment and financial services and 
marketing services and the Board of Directors (Chief Operating Decision Maker “CODM”) reviews 
the information at the revenue level and does not allocate operating costs and expenses, assets and 
liabilities across business units, as the CODM does not use such information to allocate resources or 
evaluate the performance of the business units. Allocation of resources and assessment of financial 
performance is done at the consolidated level. The way the CODM reviews the performance, 
management of the Company has concluded that it constitutes a single segment as per Ind AS 108 
'Operating Segments'. Hence, no separate disclosure is required for segments.
The Group has revenues primarily from customers domiciled in India. Substantially all of the Group’s 
non-current operating assets are domiciled in India.
Information about major customers
Revenues of INR 8,264 are derived from one customer (March 31, 2023: INR 8,590 from one customer).

The Group reviews the goodwill for any impairment at the CGU level. The recoverable amount of the 
above CGUs are based on value-in-use, which is determined based on five year business plans that 
have been approved by the management for internal purposes. The said planning horizon of five years 
reflects the assumptions for short to medium-term market developments. The cash flows beyond the 
planning period are extrapolated using appropriate terminal growth rates. The terminal growth rates 
used do not exceed the long term average growth rates of the respective industry and country in 
which the entity operates and are consistent with the internal/external sources of information.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations are as follows: 
 
 
Earnings before interest and taxes margins (‘EBIT’) 
 
 
Discount rate
 
 
Growth rates
	
EBIT margins: The margins have been estimated based on past experience after considering 
incremental revenue arising out of increase in payment business from the existing and new 
customers. Margins will be positively impacted from the efficiencies and initiatives driven by the 
Group; whereas, factors like increased cost of operations may impact the margins negatively.
	
Discount rate: Discount rate reflects the current market assessment of the risks specific to 
the CGU estimated based on the weighted average cost of capital. Pre-tax discount rate used 
ranged from 18% to 21% (March 31, 2023: 20% to 25%) which in the opinion of management are 
consistent with companies in similar business.
	
Growth rates: The terminal growth rates used are in the opinion of management in line with the 
long-term average growth rates of the respective industry in which the entity operates and are 
consistent with the internal/external sources of information. The terminal growth rates used in 
extrapolating cash flows beyond the planning period, range from 1.5 to 2.5 times (March 31, 
2023: 1.5 to 2.5 times) of revenue for the terminal year.
	
Goodwill Impairment
	
As at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the estimated recoverable amount of CGU exceeded 
its carrying amount and accordingly, no impairment was recognised. An analysis of the 
sensitivity of the computation to change in key assumptions based on reasonable probability 
did not identify any possible scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would 
decrease below its carrying amount.
B.	 Investment in Associate
	
For impairment testing, the management has treated investment in PPBL as a separate CGU 
and there is no change in the composition of this CGU since previous estimate of its recoverable 
amount. The impairment loss pertains to single segment as identified in note 34.
	
Considering the factors stated in note 45, the Holding Company has determined, on a prudent 
basis, that both the value-in-use and fair value less cost of disposal of the Holding Company’s 
investment in PPBL are nil at the reporting date. Since the management has used qualitative 
factors to determine value-in-use as well as fair value less cost of disposal of the Holding 
Company’s investment in PPBL, separate disclosures such as fair value hierarchy, valuation 
technique and assumptions used including discount rate are not separately given.

aggregating to INR 7. Based on response from AD Bank/RBI, these companies have obtained the 
STPI registration and are in the process of filing their respective applications for condonation of 
delays in respect of reporting of export of software and submission of SOFTEX forms with the 
STPI authorities.
The Group believes that there is no material financial impact of the above matters.
40. Transfer pricing
The Group has established a comprehensive system of maintenance of information and documents 
as required by the transfer pricing legislation under sections 92-92F of the Income Tax Act, 1961/
applicable regulations. For this purpose, the Group has appointed independent consultants for 
conducting Transfer Pricing Study. Management is of the opinion that its international transactions 
with associated enterprises have been undertaken at arms' length basis at duly negotiated prices 
on usual commercial terms. The transfer pricing study of the Holding Company for the year ended 
March 31, 2023 has been completed which did not result in any material adjustment.

Company has spent an amount of INR 8 (March 31, 2023: INR 26) as CSR expenditure.

42. Notes given by the subsidiary in respective Financial Statements/
Information:
Paytm Payments Services Limited:
The Company filed an application for authorization to set up Payment System (‘PA application’) 
under sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 with the 
Department of Payment and Settlement Systems, Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) on January 8, 
2021, in response to which, the Company received a letter from the RBI on November 25, 2022. 
As per the letter, the Company was required to obtain necessary approval for past downward 
investment from its parent company, One 97 Communications Limited ("OCL"), in compliance with 
Foreign Direct Investment (“FDI”) Guidelines and resubmit the PA application within 120 calendar 
days. Pursuant to the aforesaid, the Company had applied to the requisite government authorities 
seeking approval for the past downward investment made by OCL on December 14, 2022, which 
is still under process.
Further, the Company has received an extension of time from RBI, vide its letter dated March 23, 
2023, for resubmission of the application. As per RBI's letter, the Company can continue with the 
online payment aggregation business, while it awaits approval from Government of India (‘GoI’) for 
past downward investment from OCL into the Company and needs to resubmit the PA application 
within 15 days of receipt of the approval from GoI and to inform RBI immediately, if any adverse 
decision is taken by the GoI.
Management has assessed that this does not have a material impact on the financial statements 
and the business and revenues since the communication from RBI is applicable only to onboarding 
of new merchants. Accordingly, no adjustment has been made in these financial statements.
43. Utilisation of IPO proceeds
During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Holding Company had completed its initial public offer 
(IPO) of 85,116,278 equity shares of face value of INR 1 each at an issue price of INR 2,150 per 
share, comprising fresh issue of 38,604,651 shares and offer for sale of 46,511,627 shares by 
selling shareholders. Pursuant to the IPO, the equity shares of the Holding Company were listed 
on National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE) and BSE Limited (BSE) on November 18, 2021.
The Holding Company has incurred INR 3,983 as IPO related expenses and allocated such expenses 
between the Company INR 1,806 and selling shareholders INR 2,177. Such amounts were allocated

(Amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
45. On January 31, 2024, the RBI issued a Press Release for action against Paytm Payments Bank 
Ltd (‘PPBL’), a 49% associate of the Company, under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 
1949, effectively restricting PPBL’s normal business, permitting only withdrawal of the existing 
customer balances.
Pursuant to the RBI’s actions as stated above, the Company has terminated its Nodal Accounts 
being maintained with PPBL. Subsequently, the Company has discontinued all major business 
activities it had with PPBL. Further, the Company has also made amendment to the shareholders 
agreement with PPBL by simplifying the terms therein and has also withdrawn its nominee director 
from the board of PPBL.
The business of PPBL has been significantly impacted by the RBI action described above. As of 
date, the audited financial statements of PPBL are not available and, accordingly, the Company 
has accounted for its share of losses and OCI of PPBL, based on unaudited financial information of 
PPBL as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024. 
As at March 31, 2024, the Company has investments in PPBL amounting to INR 2,271 after 
considering its share of loss of INR 276 and share of other comprehensive gain of INR 31, for the 
year ended March 31, 2024, on the basis of unaudited financial information.
The Company understand that there are certain factors affecting ongoing operations of PPBL, 
including restrictions which affect normal operations of the primary products such as wallet and 
banking services etc as per regulatory action on Jan 31, 2024, as well as ongoing uncertainty on 
the timing and nature of restoration of any of the impacted services.
Considering the future uncertainties associated on the business operations of PPBL as mentioned 
above, including the uncertainty of any other regulatory developments, the scaled down business 
operations of PPBL, restrictions affecting normal operations of the primary products such as saving 
accounts, current accounts, wallet, as well as non-availability of audited financial information from 
PPBL, the management, on a prudent basis, has determined that the value of the Company’s 
investment in PPBL is impaired and, accordingly, has recorded an impairment provision of INR 2,271, 
representing the carrying value of its investment in PPBL and disclosed the same as Impairment of 
investment in associate.
46. The Company during the year ended March 31, 2022 granted 21,000,000 Employee Stock Options 
to Managing Director and CEO of the Holding Company which is subject to achievement of specified 
milestones. During the current year, the Holding Company has received a Show Cause Notice (“SCN”) 
from SEBI related to the above options regarding compliance with SEBI SBEB Regulations. The Holding 
Company has submitted its preliminary response and is in the process of seeking further information 
from SEBI in this regard. Based on an independent legal opinion obtained by the management, it 
believes that the Holding Company is compliant with the relevant regulations. Accordingly, there is no 
impact on the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.

accounting software for maintaining their books of account which have a feature of recording audit 
trail (edit log) facility and the same has operated throughout the year for all relevant transactions 
recorded in the software except that, audit trail feature is not enabled and thus not operated for

audit trail feature in respect of accounting software, which have the feature of audit trail, has not 
been tampered with.
The feature of recording audit trail (edit log) facility was not enabled for certain sub-systems

underlying transactions in respect of 4 subsidiaries and joint ventures and the same did not

in these systems.
