""Justification"": ""All directors are marked as non-permanent board members. According to the report, Gopalasamudram Srinivasaraghavan Sundararajan's appointment date is within the last five years and therefore considered 'Not permanent'. Similarly, Rajeev Krishnamuralilal Agarwal, Ashit Ranjit Lilani, Ravi Chandra Adusumalli, Madhur Deora, and Vijay Shekhar Sharma are also marked as 'Not permanent' due to their appointment dates falling within the last five years. Pallavi Shardul Shroff is the only director marked as 'Permanent', but there is no information indicating that any board member belongs to a lender group. The report does not link any of the directors to lenders, so it cannot be assumed that any of the permanent or non-permanent board members are representatives of lenders. Therefore, I score this content 2, as all directors are marked as non-permanent board members.""

The company has a policy addressing conflicts of interest, titled 'Conflicts of Interest Policy, Version 2.0', which outlines the minimum expectations regarding business practices to avoid conflicts of interest and mandates disclosures of any potential or existing conflicts of interest to a manager and HRBP.

The policy explicitly addresses several scenarios of potential conflict, including outside employment, financial investments, relationships with family, friends, and romantic partners, supplier and customer relationships, and gifts and entertainment. The broad scope of this section suggests that it would encompass potential conflicts of interest arising from board cross-linkages.

Additionally, the company has no incidents of stakeholder conflict of interest reported. While there is no explicit mention of preventing executive directors from being on the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the committee does not include any non-independent director as of December 31st, 2024.

The Audit Committee does not have any executive directors or non-independent directors, and the company does disclose related party transactions, including those with entities where board members have other directorships. Finally, there is no direct mention of any linkages between key management personnel or board members and key suppliers or vendors, but the report emphasizes compliance with regulations requiring transparency regarding such relationships.""..."

2025-05-18 15:38:39,PAYTM,1,16,2,"The content does not indicate any structures or mechanisms that could violate minority stakeholders' rights. Specifically, there is no mention of pyramidal holding structures (page 96), and the report explicitly states that disclosures related to promoter shareholding are not applicable due to the company being professionally managed without an identifiable promoter. The report also provides detailed information on holdings and ownership percentages, although tracing ultimate beneficiary may require careful analysis. Additionally, cross-entity holdings are disclosed, but determining complicated relationships would require further examination beyond simple assessment. Overall, there is no evidence that structures or mechanisms could violate minority stakeholders' rights."

These policies address the safety and welfare of employees by outlining procedures for preventing and addressing sexual harassment and promoting equal opportunities for persons with disabilities. Additionally, the company's Employee Learning & Development Policy (Version 1.0) focuses on proactive risk mitigation through training and awareness programs, which indirectly contributes to a safer work environment. Although there isn't a single policy explicitly stating that training is mandatory, it can be inferred from the policies that training is provided. Furthermore, Paytm has reported no accidents involving employees during the year in their Annual Report (FY24)."

Additionally, the report notes overdue amounts and explains the circumstances surrounding them. This indicates that the company has delayed payments to some lenders, creditors, and suppliers."
2025-04-06 22:27:39,PAYTM,2,22,2,"Paytm's website provides several policies that demonstrate a comprehensive commitment to ethical conduct, anti-corruption, and anti-bribery measures. The **Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy** explicitly prohibits bribery and corruption in any form, detailing consequences of violations and outlining reporting procedures. Measures related to anti-corruption and anti-bribery include prohibition on bribery and facilitation payments, internal controls to prevent and detect violations, compliance with anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws, and reporting mechanisms for concerns. The company's policies also emphasize transparency, integrity, and respect, with disciplinary action for failure to adhere to the code. This suggests that Paytm has a strong commitment to ethical practices and is clearly anti-corruption and anti-bribery."

In FY22, the company spent ₹14 million on CSR activities despite reporting a loss.

Additionally, there are vintage members on the board, including Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma and Mr. Ravi Chandra Adusumalli, who have not explicitly affirmed their independence annually.
