2025-03-01 07:32:49,5,1,10,combined_policies,Does the company have policy regarding conflict of interest with stakeholders? Does it cover board cross linkages? You are looking at the policies extracted from the company website. Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.,"Yes, One97 Communications Limited (Paytm) has a policy addressing conflicts of interest.  The policy, titled ""Conflicts of Interest Policy, Version 2.0,"" which was extracted from the company website, outlines the minimum expectations regarding business practices to avoid conflicts of interest.

The policy explicitly addresses several scenarios of potential conflict, including outside employment, financial investments, relationships with family, friends, and romantic partners, supplier and customer relationships, and gifts and entertainment.  It also mandates disclosures of any potential or existing conflicts of interest to a manager and HRBP.

While the policy doesn't explicitly use the term ""board cross linkages,""  the section on ""Outside Employment and preserving Business Interests"" (5.1)  implies that if a board member has external employment that could potentially impact their duties or create a conflict with Paytm's interests, then it should be disclosed and managed as per the policy.  The policy's scope extends to all employees, trainees, consultants, and associates, including (implicitly) members of the board.  The broad scope of this section suggests that it would encompass such cross linkages.  Therefore, while the wording isn't explicit, the principles of the policy would likely apply to potential conflicts of interest arising from board cross-linkages.

However, the report does disclose related party transactions, including those with entities where board members have other directorships.  These disclosures are detailed in the ""Related Party Transactions"" section, starting on page 247 of the Annual Report.  The report emphasizes compliance with regulations requiring transparency regarding such relationships, but doesn't explicitly state a lack of direct connections.

The report notes that SAMCO's revenue from Paytm is a small portion of their overall business and that Mrs. Shroff meets the independence criteria, receiving only remuneration as an independent director.  (Page 28, Section II, Information about the Non-Executive Independent Directors.)

The report states that as of March 31, 2024, the company is a professionally managed company and does not have an identifiable promoter.  Therefore, disclosures related to promoter shareholding are not applicable.

There is no mention of pyramidal holding structures in the annual report that would disproportionately give more voting power to promoters.

The report clearly outlines the ownership interest held by various entities, including subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures.  However,  the complexity of the structure, particularly the involvement of entities in different jurisdictions and the presence of indirect ownership, does make it challenging to immediately determine the ultimate beneficiary.  The report explicitly addresses the shareholding percentages at various levels of the structure, on page 90 and further clarifies certain complex holdings on pages 247, 251, 252, 357-361,  but tracing complete ownership across all layers requires careful analysis.  Therefore, while not opaque in the sense of withholding crucial information, the intricacy of the structure may make determining the ultimate beneficiary a complex task.

The report details the holdings of One 97 Communications Limited and its subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures on pages 247-255.  This section lists each entity, its ownership percentage, and whether it's a subsidiary, associate, or joint venture.  

While the data is extensive, a simple assessment cannot definitively identify *complicated* cross-holdings.

* **Equal Employment Opportunity Policy for Persons with Disabilities:** This policy promotes a safe and inclusive work environment by ensuring equal opportunities for employees with disabilities and providing appropriate accommodations.

* **Code of Conduct:** While not solely focused on health and safety, this overarching policy establishes general standards of conduct and respect for each other, which indirectly contributes to a safer and more supportive work environment.  This contributes to employee welfare.

While it doesn't explicitly state ""prevention of occupation-related injuries,"" the policy focuses on proactive risk mitigation through training and awareness programs.


Specifically, section 5 of the policy, *Risk Mitigation*, states that integrating risk mitigation into learning initiatives equips employees with the tools and knowledge to navigate challenges effectively.  This includes training on:


*   **Compliance**:  Ensuring compliance with relevant laws and standards, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidents and injuries due to non-compliance.
*   **Cybersecurity Awareness**:  Mitigating risks associated with data breaches and cyber threats, which could indirectly cause workplace accidents or injuries in the case of system failures.
*   **Ethical Conduct**:  Promoting safe work practices and reducing risky behaviors.
*   **Risk Management**: Empowering employees to identify and mitigate risks, including those related to workplace safety.
*   **Product Knowledge**:  Reducing errors by ensuring employees have thorough training on products and procedures.


The policy highlights the importance of risk mitigation as a key component of employee learning and development, thereby implicitly promoting workplace safety and the prevention of injuries, accidents, and illnesses.  This is an indirect approach to mitigating workplace hazards but shows a dedication to proactive risk management, which is a vital aspect of preventing occupation-related incidents.

The **Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (POSH)**, states that the company is committed to providing a work environment that is transparent in its conduct, being fair and non-discriminatory.  This policy  covers the key aspects of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.  (Page 33)

The **Equal Employment Opportunity Policy for Persons with Disabilities** mentions that the company is committed to providing a work environment that is inclusive and non-discriminatory, and promotes equal opportunities for personnel irrespective of gender.  It also mentions that the company will provide adequate facilities and amenities to persons with disabilities to enable them to effectively discharge their duties. (Page 43)

Both policies are sourced from Paytm's website.  Note that these policies mention training and providing a safe working environment, rather than explicitly stating that training is mandatory.  Further details regarding mandatory training programs, if any, would require review of further internal documentation.

Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.","Based on the provided document extracts from Paytm's website, the answer is **yes**, some policies related to health, safety and welfare cover the company's suppliers and vendors.  However, there isn't a single policy explicitly stating this for *all* health, safety and welfare aspects.  The coverage is implied and spread across multiple policies:


* **Code of Conduct:** While this document doesn't directly mention supplier/vendor health and safety, section 1, ""Our Ways of Working,"" sets out a commitment to high standards of professional conduct that extends to business partners and stakeholders. This implies a certain level of expectation for ethical behavior which would likely incorporate some basic health and safety standards.  Also section 2.2, ""What is my Responsibility,"" explicitly covers the expectation of ethical conduct for suppliers and vendors.

* **Protection & Use of Company Property:** This policy (section 7) indirectly addresses supplier responsibility in relation to their handling of company property and data.  A violation by a supplier could lead to penalties and legal action.

* **Compliance with Laws, Rules & Regulations:**  This section (section 8) explicitly requires compliance from suppliers with legal requirements.  This compliance may cover aspects of health, safety, and welfare depending on applicable law.

It's important to note that while the policies aim to create a responsible business environment, the specific extent of their application regarding supplier health, safety, and welfare will be influenced by individual contracts and applicable laws.  There isn't a dedicated policy explicitly outlining health and safety standards for all suppliers and vendors in one place.

Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.","Based on the provided document extracts from Paytm's website, here's the information regarding supplier/vendor selection and management:

**Supplier/Vendor Selection:**

The document doesn't contain a specific policy solely dedicated to supplier/vendor selection. However, some aspects are mentioned within other policies.  Specifically, the **Information Security Policy** touches upon supplier selection in section 23, ""Supplier Relationships"":

> *All the suppliers (outsourcing vendors, agents, third parties and other contract employees) who have access to internal information / information assets to maintain confidentiality and adopt security procedures. Supplier’s access to internal information / information assets shall be restricted. Refer (Supplier Relationship Management Policy) for detailed policy.*

This excerpt shows that security is a key criterion during the selection process, implying a vetting procedure occurs to ensure suppliers meet Paytm's security standards before granting access to sensitive information.  There is no explicit detail of what other standards are applied beyond this security focus.

**Supplier/Vendor Management:**

The **Information Security Policy** (Section 23, ""Supplier Relationships"") also touches on vendor management:

> *All the suppliers (outsourcing vendors, agents, third parties and other contract employees) who have access to internal information / information assets to maintain confidentiality and adopt security procedures. Supplier’s access to internal information / information assets shall be restricted. Refer (Supplier Relationship Management Policy) for detailed policy.*

Again,  the focus here is on managing security risks associated with the suppliers' access to sensitive information.  The policy mandates restricting access and adopting security procedures.  The document also directs the reader to a separate policy, ""Supplier Relationship Management Policy"", for more comprehensive details on vendor management,  but the contents of that separate policy are not provided.

**Verdict:**

Paytm has explicit policies concerning Information Security, which includes some aspects of supplier selection and management, primarily focusing on security. However,  a dedicated and comprehensive policy specifically detailing the full criteria for supplier/vendor selection and a full management framework is not present in these extracts.  The existence of a separate ""Supplier Relationship Management Policy"" is mentioned, but its content is unavailable in these document extracts. Therefore, while there is evidence of security-focused processes, a complete picture of Paytm's supplier selection and management policies is not available from the provided documents alone.

**Auditor's Report and Opinions:**

The independent auditor's report (pages 171-178 for standalone and 285-295 for consolidated financial statements) expresses an *unmodified opinion* on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements of Paytm for the year ended March 31, 2024.  This means the auditors found the financial statements to be fairly presented and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in India.


**Emphasis of Matter:**

* **Standalone Financial Statements:** The auditors highlight two *key audit matters*  (page 172):

    1. **Impairment of investment in Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL):** Due to RBI restrictions on PPBL's operations, an impairment loss was recognized.  The auditors describe their procedures to address this (verification of RBI press release, discussions with management, testing of arithmetical accuracy, and assessment of relevant disclosures).

    2. **Recoverable value of investment in subsidiaries and other associates:**  The determination of recoverable value involved significant judgements and estimates.  The auditors again outline their steps to assess this (evaluation of the company's impairment model, checking data against budgets, assessing sensitivity analysis, and ensuring relevant disclosures).

* **Consolidated Financial Statements:** The auditors state one *emphasis of matter* (page 286):

    1. **Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL):**  Similar to the standalone report, the impact of RBI restrictions on PPBL is highlighted.  The auditors' procedures to assess this are detailed (review of RBI press release and FAQs, discussion with management, testing of arithmetical accuracy, and review of disclosures).


**Management Comments on Key Audit Matters:**

Management's discussion and analysis sections (pages 8-21) address the RBI directive and subsequent actions taken by Paytm, including the transition of PPBL services to other partners.  They discuss how these measures aimed to de-risk the business model and open up long-term monetization opportunities.


**Auditor Resignation:**

There is no mention in the report of any auditor resigning due to a difference of opinion or any suspicious reason.  While the report notes a change of statutory auditors for Paytm Payments Services Limited (PPSL) (page 95), this was due to a resignation, and not linked to any disputes or concerns.

* **Qualified Opinion:** The independent auditor, Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants LLP, did *not* issue a qualified opinion on Paytm's standalone financial statements.  Their opinion was unmodified. (Page 179)

* **Emphasis of Matter:** The auditors did highlight one key audit matter concerning the assessment of the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries and associates (Page 180).  The report details the procedures undertaken to address this matter.  Management's assessment of the carrying value was considered reasonable by the auditors.

* **Auditor Resignation:** There is no mention of an auditor resigning due to a difference of opinion or any suspicious reason in the auditor's report.  The report only mentions the planned rotation of statutory auditors, with M/s. S.R. Batliboi & Associates LLP succeeding M/s. Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants LLP (Page 237).


**Management's Response (Page 204-209):**

The ""Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged With Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements"" section (Page 181) details management's responsibilities regarding the preparation of the financial statements. This section includes a discussion of their assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern and the use of accounting estimates. However, there is no direct response to the auditor's key audit matter emphasis.  It's implied that the management is confident that their approach and justifications are sound given the auditor's unmodified opinion.

**Qualified Opinion:**

The independent auditor's report (page 78) expresses an *unmodified* opinion on the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  This means no qualified opinion was issued.

**Emphasis of Matter:**

Yes, there are *emphasis of matter* paragraphs in both the standalone and consolidated auditor's reports.

* **Standalone Report (page 78):**  The auditors highlight two key matters:
    1. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business operations (Note 2.1).  The auditors acknowledge the uncertainty of its future impact.
    2. Non-realization of foreign currency receivables and non-settlement of foreign currency payables (Note 35). The auditors note the management's actions to address these issues but state that their opinion is not modified.

* **Consolidated Report (page 169):** The auditors highlight three key matters:
    1.  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (Note 2.1). Similar to the standalone report, they acknowledge the uncertainty of future impact.
    2. Non-realization of foreign currency receivables and non-settlement of foreign currency payables (Note 39).  Again, they note management's actions and state that their opinion is not modified.
    3.  A subsidiary's classification as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) (Note 42). The auditors note that the subsidiary's management does not intend to operate as an NBFC and has applied for a dispensation from RBI.  The auditors' opinion is not modified.


**Management's Comments:**

The management's discussion and analysis section provides context to the emphasis of matter paragraphs raised by the auditors.  In the case of the COVID-19 impact, management discusses the steps taken to manage the pandemic's effects and the progress towards profitability. Regarding foreign currency transactions, management explains the actions they have undertaken and clarifies the related details. For the NBFC classification, management states that the subsidiary does not intend to operate as an NBFC and has made the necessary application for dispensation.

**Auditor Resignation:**

There is no mention in the auditor's report that the auditors resigned due to a difference of opinion or for any suspicious reason.  The reports indicate a continued working relationship and the issuance of unmodified opinions.

The policy further clarifies materiality in section 3.9 by defining ""Material Modification"":

> ""Material Modification” In case of any Related Party Transaction, any commercial change which results in either: (a) reduction in the revenue by 10% or more of the overall amount approved by Audit Committee, Board or Shareholders, as the case may be or INR 100 crores, whichever is higher, or; (b) increase in the cost by 10% or more of the overall amount approved by Audit Committee, Board or Shareholders, as the case may be or INR 100 crores, whichever is higher, or; (c) changes in the core nature of such transaction.""


Therefore, the policy explicitly addresses both the definition of materiality and the criteria for determining when a modification to an existing related party transaction constitutes a material change.

I apologize that I could not provide the requested information in my previous response.  My search of the provided Paytm Annual Report (FY24) did not locate a table summarizing the qualifications, field of expertise, and experience for each board member and key management personnel in the format requested.  The report does contain some biographical information on board members and key management personnel, but it is spread across multiple pages and sections, and not consistently formatted.  This makes compiling the exact data points you need difficult using only OCR.

To get the information you need, I recommend:

1. **Directly Accessing the Paytm Website:** Go to the official Paytm investor relations website.  Their annual reports often contain more detailed information than what's available via OCR.  Look for the FY24 annual report's section on corporate governance, the board of directors, or key management personnel.  These sections will likely contain the biographical details you're requesting.

2. **Reviewing the Full PDF:** If you already downloaded the Paytm annual report PDF, open it directly.  The PDF will be more reliable for finding the specific details than relying on OCR's text extraction.

I cannot directly access and process online documents or external websites (including Paytm's website), so I am unable to provide you with the information from those sources.

**Note:** The annual report doesn't specify the number of years of experience for most board members in their respective areas of expertise.  Only broad areas of expertise are mentioned, and not a precise quantification of experience.  


**Collective Board Expertise (Over 10 Years):**

To determine collective expertise exceeding 10 years, we need precise years of experience for each director in each area. This information is not readily available in the provided document.  The report only provides broad areas of expertise.  Therefore, it is impossible to definitively answer which areas the board collectively possesses expertise for more than 10 years based solely on the information provided.
That's a much clearer phrasing of the request.  To make it even better, let's add some context about the source material:

""Based on the Paytm Annual Report (FY24), can you please provide information on the area(s) of expertise for each board member and their corresponding number of years of experience?  Specifically, are there any areas where the *combined* expertise of the board members exceeds 10 years?""


This revised question:

* Clearly specifies the source document (Paytm's FY24 Annual Report).
* Uses the word ""combined"" to clarify that you're looking for the total number of years of expertise across *all* board members in a given area, not just individual expertise exceeding 10 years.
* Remains concise and professional.

This should allow for a more accurate and efficient search for the information.  Let me know if you need further clarification.

R2 = 44.51 crore / -14,224 crore = **-0.00313**


**Important Note:**  The ratio R2 is negative because the company had a net *loss*, not a net profit, for the year.  This means that the CEO's compensation is 0.313% of the total net losses incurred.

Get the dividend payout ratio along with its guidance. You are looking at the policies extracted from the company website. Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name. ","Yes, One 97 Communications Limited has a Dividend Distribution Policy.  The policy, as of July 21, 2023 (Version 4.0), does *not* specify a dividend payout ratio.  Instead, it outlines the parameters the Board will consider before recommending a dividend.  These parameters are categorized into financial and external factors, and are listed in section 6 of the policy.  These parameters are:


**Financial Parameters:**

* Profit earned and available for distribution during the financial year
* Accumulated Reserves including Retained Earnings
* Earnings outlook for the next three to five years
* Expected future capital/expenditure requirements of the Company
* Organic growth plans/expansions
* Long-term investment proposed, capital restructuring, debt reduction
* Cost of raising funds from alternate sources
* Crystallization of contingent liabilities of the Company
* Net Profit earned during the financial year as per the consolidated Financial Statements
* Cash Flows
* Current and projected Cash balance
* Debt repayment schedules, if any
* Impact of dividend payout on Company's return on equity, while simultaneously maintaining prudent and reasonably conservative leveraging in every respect viz. interest coverage, DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) Net Debt: EBITDA and Net debt: Equity, including maintaining a targeted rating domestically and internationally
* Fund requirement for contingencies and unforeseen events with financial implications
* Past Dividend trend including Interim dividend paid, if any
* Any other relevant factors and material events


**External Parameters:**

* Macro-economic environment
* Regulatory changes
* Technological changes
* Other factors like statutory and contractual restrictions


The policy clearly states that the Board will use its discretion in determining the amount of profit to be distributed to shareholders, and under what circumstances a dividend may or may not be expected.  While these parameters provide guidance, the final decision rests with the Board.  Therefore, there is no fixed dividend payout ratio.
