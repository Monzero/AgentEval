3/1/25 9:05,PAYTM,2,18,2,"Paytm has publicly disclosed its health and safety policies, including the Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (POSH) and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy for Persons with Disabilities. Additionally, the company's Employee Learning & Development Policy (Version 1.0) focuses on proactive risk mitigation through training and awareness programs, which indirectly contributes to a safer work environment. The policies also emphasize the importance of creating an inclusive and non-discriminatory work environment. Furthermore, Paytm's Annual Report (FY24) reveals that there were no accidents involving employees during the year and no fatalities. References: Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (POSH), page 33; Equal Employment Opportunity Policy for Persons with Disabilities, page 43; Employee Learning & Development Policy (Version 1.0); Paytm Annual Report (FY24), pages 126-128."
3/1/25 9:05,PAYTM,2,19,2,"The company has publicly disclosed its policy on prevention of sexual harassment, titled 'Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (POSH)' and details a formal redressal mechanism. The document also outlines procedures for preventing such incidents, receiving complaints, conducting inquiries, and providing remedies. Additionally, the company's Annual Report 2024 mentions that it has a constituted Internal Complaints Committee (“ICC”) to address complaints, and employees receive mandatory training on the POSH policy annually. Although there is no information on specific sexual harassment incidents, the report does mention one complaint pending from the previous fiscal year (2022-23) that was resolved during 2023-24. This suggests that the company has provided information on the number of sexual harassment incidents and publicly disclosed its prevention of sexual harassment policy."
3/1/25 9:05,PAYTM,2,20,1,"Paytm has explicit policies concerning Information Security, which includes some aspects of supplier selection and management, primarily focusing on security. However, a dedicated and comprehensive policy specifically detailing the full criteria for supplier/vendor selection and a full management framework is not present in these extracts. The existence of a separate ""Supplier Relationship Management Policy"" is mentioned, but its content is unavailable in these document extracts. Therefore, while there is evidence of security-focused processes, a complete picture of Paytm's supplier selection and management policies is not available from the provided documents alone."
3/1/25 9:05,PAYTM,2,21,0,"Yes, the annual report of One 97 Communications Limited as of March 31, 2024, indicates some delayed repayments to lenders, creditors, and suppliers (Annexure 1 to the Independent Auditor's Report, page 182). The report notes overdue amounts for undisputed statutory dues, including goods and service tax, employee state insurance, income tax, etc. This suggests that the company has delayed payments to certain parties. Although the report does not explicitly label all these as 'delayed', it notes overdue amounts and explains the circumstances surrounding them."
3/1/25 9:05,PAYTM,2,22,2,"Paytm's policies, as found on their website, demonstrate a comprehensive commitment to ethical conduct, anti-corruption, and anti-bribery measures, with clear consequences for non-compliance. The **Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy** clearly states that One97 Communications Limited has zero tolerance for bribery and corruption in any form, outlining measures such as prohibition on bribery and facilitation payments, internal controls to prevent and detect violations, compliance with anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws, and reporting mechanisms for concerns. The policies demonstrate a clear commitment to ethical standards and anti-corruption practices, making Paytm's overall score 2."
3/1/25 9:06,PAYTM,3,28,2,"The auditor's report expresses an unmodified opinion on both standalone and consolidated financial statements, indicating that no major concerns or qualified opinions were raised. The auditors highlighted two key audit matters in the standalone report and three in the consolidated report, but their opinions remained unmodified. There is no mention of auditor resignation due to a difference of opinion or any suspicious reason."
3/1/25 9:06,PAYTM,3,32,2,"The One 97 Communications Limited **Policy on Related Party Transactions (Version 4.0)** defines 'ordinary course of business' and clarifies that these criteria are not exhaustive, and the company will assess each transaction considering its specific nature and circumstances. The policy also covers the definition and materiality of transactions, defining 'Material Related Party Transaction' as a transaction exceeding INR 1,000 Crore or ten percent of the annual consolidated turnover of the Company. Furthermore, it defines 'Material Modification' as a change resulting in either a reduction or increase in the revenue or cost by 10% or more of the overall amount approved. However, there is no mention of a requirement for external auditors to review material related party transactions."
3/1/25 9:24,PAYTM,3,36,2,"The company transparently discloses the information about the shareholding pattern and top 10 shareholders in its annual report. The shareholding pattern is presented on page 90, breaking down the shareholding into categories such as Promoter and Promoter Group, Public Shareholding, and Non-Institutional Investor. Each category has specific numbers listed. Additionally, the annual report lists the top 10 shareholders holding more than 1% of the shares as on March 31, 2024, including exact percentage shareholding for each entity on page 88. Furthermore, the report clarifies that Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma is the sole Significant Beneficial Owner (SBO) of the Company as of August 14, 2023."
3/1/25 9:24,PAYTM,3,37,0,"Based on the provided corporate governance report, the shareholding information for board members and key management personnel is not explicitly listed in a tabular format providing both the number of shares and percentage of total shares. The report does provide shareholding information categorized by shareholder type (Promoter & Promoter Group, Public, etc.), but it does not break down holdings to individual board members or key management personnel. Therefore, I cannot fulfill your request to list all board members and key management personnel and their shareholding information as it is not present in the provided document. The shareholding pattern sections only show aggregate data for categories of shareholders (Promoters, Public, etc.) and not the breakdown for individual directors."
3/1/25 9:24,PAYTM,3,38,1,"Although One97 Communications Limited has a Dividend Distribution Policy that outlines parameters for determining dividend distribution, it does not specify a fixed dividend payout ratio. The policy emphasizes that the Board retains discretion in determining dividend payout. Although there have been deviations from the policy (no dividend was declared in FY 2022-23 and FY 2024 due to lack of profits), the company's annual reports provide clear guidance on the reasons for these deviations, which is acceptable under the scoring criteria."
3/1/25 9:24,PAYTM,3,44,0,No justification provided.
3/1/25 9:24,PAYTM,3,45,2,"Based on my review of the Paytm Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2024, there is no mention of any directors, board members, or key management personnel being fined by regulatory bodies or stock exchanges. I have thoroughly examined the relevant sections of the report, including the ""Board's Report"" (pages 22-69), ""Corporate Governance Report"" (pages 60-136), and the ""Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting"" section (pages 103-169), and found no such information."
3/1/25 9:24,PAYTM,4,48,2,"Based on the provided information, we can calculate the overall attendance ratio for all board members. As of March 31, 2024, the average attendance ratio for the board members who have been on the board for at least three years is approximately 91.2%. This indicates that most board members have an excellent attendance record. The only exceptions are Mrs. Pallavi Shardul Shroff and Mr. Ashit Ranjit Lilani, both of whom had an attendance rate of around 88.89%. Considering this information, the overall attendance ratio for all board members is more than 0.90, which corresponds to a score of 2."
3/1/25 9:24,PAYTM,4,49,2,"The Board of One97 Communications Limited met nine times during the financial year 2023-24 (April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024), exceeding the minimum threshold of four meetings. The text explicitly states that 'the board met nine times during the financial year 2023-24', which is mentioned on page 62 of the Annual Report (as of March 31, 2024). Additionally, it is noted that some business was transacted through circulation to meet urgent requirements. This information confirms that the board met more than four times, warranting a score of 2."
3/1/25 9:32,PAYTM,4,51,0,"Although some individual board members have relevant experience, collectively the board does not possess strong expertise (more than 10 years) in any specific area due to lack of quantifiable information about their expertise. Additionally, while some board members have prior experience in the financial technology industry, it is unclear whether they have experience specifically in the sector Paytm operates in."
3/1/25 9:32,PAYTM,4,52,1,"The gender ratio of independent directors on the Paytm board as of March 31, 2024, is 25% (1/4), which is less than 0.3 but more than 0. According to the source, 'Paytm Annual Report 2024', page 5, there is one woman and three men among the independent directors."
3/1/25 9:33,PAYTM,4,53,1,"The Paytm Annual Report (2024) reports that out of a total workforce of 28,107 employees, 1,603 are female, which translates to a percentage of 5.70%. Although the percentage is below 0.3, it falls within the range of 0.1 to 0.3, as mentioned in the scoring criteria. (Source: Paytm Annual Report (2024), page 105)"
3/1/25 9:33,PAYTM,4,54,1,"Although Paytm's chairman, Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma, is also the executive/promoter, the company has an independence of board members score of 0.5714 or more (57.14%). This meets the criteria for a Score 1. Additionally, although there are vintage members on the board who do not explicitly affirm their independence annually, they have affirmed compliance with the Code of Conduct for Independent Directors as required by the company's policy."
3/1/25 9:33,PAYTM,4,55,2,"The Audit Committee and NRC committee members are independent (Criteria 1 & 2). Additionally, no member on either committee has been on the board for more than 10 years (Criteria 3), as Mr. Ravi Chandra Adusumalli is the only one with a tenure exceeding 10 years, but he is not a member of either committee. Therefore, no criteria is violated."
3/1/25 9:33,PAYTM,4,63,1,"The CEO's total compensation (INR 44.51 crore) is more than 0.05 of net profits (-INR 14,224 crore), which is INR 704.2 crore (0.05 x -INR 14,224 crore). According to the calculation R2 = CEO compensation / Net Profit (loss) = 44.51 crore / -14,224 crore = -0.00313, the ratio is negative because of the net loss. This means that the CEO's compensation is not more than 5% of the total net losses incurred. Source: Paytm Annual Report 2024, Page 22, 104"
3/1/25 9:39,PAYTM,1,4,2,"Based on the provided One 97 Communications Ltd Corporate Governance report (Page 2), all directors are marked as non-permanent board members, except for Vijay Shekhar Sharma who was initially appointed more than 5 years prior to March 31st, 2024. There is no mention of any board member belonging to a lender group in the Paytm Annual Report (FY24) or the provided One 97 Communications Ltd Corporate Governance report."
3/1/25 9:39,PAYTM,1,7,1,"The gap between March 31, 2024 (FYE) and September 12, 2024 (AGM) is 164 days, which falls within the range of 120-180 days. As per the scoring criteria, this suggests a score of 1. The justification for this score is that the gap between the FYE and AGM is not excessive or unusually long, indicating that the company is taking reasonable time to hold its annual general meeting."
3/1/25 9:40,PAYTM,1,10,2,"The policy explicitly addresses several scenarios of potential conflict, including supplier and customer relationships, and mandates disclosures of any potential or existing conflicts of interest to a manager and HRBP. The scope of this section extends to all employees, trainees, consultants, and associates, including (implicitly) members of the board. Additionally, the company has disclosed related party transactions, including those with entities where board members have other directorships. Although there is no direct mention of linkages between key management personnel or board members and key suppliers or vendors, the absence of a statement on this matter does not definitively rule out the possibility of indirect linkages that are not detailed in the annual report. The company also has disclosed past affiliations with competitors but emphasizes the independence of the board members and the lack of any current conflict of interest arising from these past affiliations."
3/1/25 9:40,PAYTM,1,12,2,"Since there are no royalty transactions mentioned in the provided JSON data, the ratio of royalty payments to related parties to the profit of the company cannot be calculated. However, we can consider the total amount of royalty transactions (₹0) and compare it to the company's loss (₹14,224 crore). As stated on page 301, the consolidated financial statement shows a loss of ₹14,224 crore. The royalty revenue contributes nothing to offsetting this loss, making the ratio trivial. Therefore, based on the criteria, we score 2 as the ratio of royalty payments to related parties to the profit of the company is less than 0.1."
3/1/25 9:40,PAYTM,1,16,2,"The content does not suggest that the structure or mechanisms could violate minority stakeholders' rights. The Paytm Annual Report 2024 (page 96) states that there are no identifiable promoters, and disclosures related to promoter shareholding are not applicable. Additionally, the report provides detailed information on the holding structure, ownership percentages, and relationships between entities, although it may require a deeper analysis to fully understand the complexity of the structure. Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that the structure or mechanisms could disproportionately affect minority stakeholders' rights."
