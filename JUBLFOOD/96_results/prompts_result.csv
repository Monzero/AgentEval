2/27/25 0:51,JUBLFOOD,1,1,4,cg_report,"You are looking at the corporate governance report. Find the reappointment date for each board members. If the reppointment date is either not provided or older than 5 years (i.e some date before 2019), then you need to check appointment date. If appointment date is also older than 5 years (i.e before 2019), mark that board member as permanent. Give list of board members and whether or not they are permanent. In other words, either of appointment date or reappointment date should be within last 5 years. For example, if a board member has appoinment date '02-07-2020' and reappointment date is not present, then because the appointment date is within last 5 years  (i.e March 2020 to March 2025 assuming we are checking for annual report as of 31st March 2025) then we would label them as 'Not permanent'. Second example, if any board member has appointment date as 01-01-2012 and reappointment date not present, then we would mark them permanent. Do not present output in table format.

Shyam S. Bhartia:  The appointment date is 16-03-1995 (Corporate Governance Report, page 2). Since this date is significantly older than five years prior to March 31st, 2024, Mr. Bhartia is considered a permanent board member.

Hari S. Bhartia: His appointment date is 16-03-1995 (Corporate Governance Report, page 2).  Similar to Mr. Shyam S. Bhartia, this date predates the five-year threshold, making Mr. Hari S. Bhartia a permanent board member.

Sameer Khetarpal:  His appointment date is 05-09-2022 (Corporate Governance Report, page 2).  This falls within the five-year window, thus Mr. Khetarpal is considered *not* permanent.

Shamit Bhartia: His appointment date is 29-05-2017 (Corporate Governance Report, page 2). Although the reappointment date is not provided and the appointment date is outside of the 5-year window (prior to 29-05-2019), Mr. Shamit Bhartia is considered a permanent board member.

Aashti Bhartia: The appointment date is 29-05-2017 (Corporate Governance Report, page 2).  Similar to Mr. Shamit Bhartia, the appointment date falls before the 5-year threshold, making Ms. Aashti Bhartia a permanent member.

Abhay Prabhakar Havaldar: His appointment date is 25-07-2018 (Corporate Governance Report, page 2). This is within the five-year timeframe; therefore, Mr. Havaldar is *not* a permanent board member.

Ashwani Windlass: The appointment date is 01-02-2019 (Corporate Governance Report, page 2). This appointment date is within the last five years, meaning Mr. Windlass is considered *not* permanent.

Vikram Singh Mehta: His appointment date is 01-02-2019 (Corporate Governance Report, page 2).  As with Mr. Windlass, this date falls within the five-year window; therefore, Mr. Mehta is considered *not* permanent.

Amit Jain: His appointment date is 01-07-2023 (Corporate Governance Report, page 2).  His appointment date clearly falls within the last five years.  Therefore, Mr. Jain is considered *not* a permanent board member.

Deepa Misra Harris: Her appointment date is 21-06-2019 (Corporate Governance Report, page 2). This falls within the five-year window, classifying Ms. Harris as *not* a permanent board member.

By ""lender group"", I am referring to the group of lenders (of any type â€” banks, financial institutions, investment firms, etc.) who may provide financing to the company.

You are looking at the policies extracted from the company website. Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.,"I am sorry, but I do not have access to external websites or specific files online, including the Jubilant FoodWorks Limited website.  Therefore, I cannot provide you with information on their conflict of interest policy or whether it covers board cross-linkages.  To find this information, you will need to visit the Jubilant FoodWorks Limited website yourself and look for documents such as a ""Code of Conduct,"" ""Corporate Governance Policy,"" or similar policy titles that might address these issues.
That's a much better-phrased question.  It's highly unlikely that a company's website will directly publish their full conflict of interest policy (for competitive and legal reasons).  However, the revised question focuses on the existence and key elements of such a policy, making it more likely to uncover relevant information within the company's website's ""Investor Relations,"" ""Governance,"" or ""About Us"" sections.


To further improve your chances of finding the answer, try these additional strategies:


* **Search terms:** Use various combinations of search terms on the Jubilant FoodWorks website, such as:  ""conflict of interest,"" ""corporate governance,"" ""ethics policy,"" ""board independence,"" ""related party transactions,"" ""stakeholder engagement,"" ""director independence,"" and ""code of conduct.""

* **Look for documents:**  Instead of just searching the text of the website, look specifically for downloadable documents, PDFs, or links to policy pages.  These are where such sensitive information is typically housed.

* **Contact Investor Relations:** If you can't find the information online, the most reliable method would be to contact Jubilant FoodWorks' Investor Relations department directly. They are responsible for providing information to stakeholders and can likely confirm the existence of a conflict of interest policy, or direct you to the appropriate source.


Remember to be polite and respectful in any communications with the company.

Therefore, yes, the committee includes both an executive director and a non-independent director.  Note that the report's date is December 2024, not March 2024 as requested.
That's a good strategy.  The rephrased question is much more likely to yield a useful answer if the information is available in publicly accessible documents.  Let's proceed with this revised question:

Here are a few rephrased questions, each with a slightly different focus, that might help find the relevant information on Jubilant FoodWorks' website:


**Option 1 (Direct & Specific):**

> Does Jubilant FoodWorks Limited have a formal policy that restricts or prohibits executive directors from serving on the Audit Committee?  If so, what is the name of that policy and where can I find it on the company website?


**Option 2 (Broader, looking for general governance):**

> What is Jubilant FoodWorks Limited's policy regarding the composition and membership of its Audit Committee, including any restrictions or guidelines on the roles of executive directors?


**Option 3 (Focusing on potential conflicts of interest):**

> What measures does Jubilant FoodWorks Limited have in place to manage potential conflicts of interest arising from executive directors serving on the Audit Committee?  Are there any specific policies addressing this?


**Option 4 (More general inquiry about director roles):**

> What are the roles and responsibilities of Jubilant FoodWorks Limited's executive directors, and what committees do they typically serve on?  Is there a published document outlining these roles?

These different phrasings cast a wider net and approach the issue from several different angles, which increases the likelihood of uncovering the relevant information, if it exists publicly.

The report does, however, detail relationships between board members and other companies, but these are not described as competitive relationships.  This information is found in Annexure A, page 11.
That's a good approach.  The original question focused on information that might not be explicitly disclosed in a standard annual report.  Focusing on potential conflicts of interest through shared directorships, professional networks, and business partnerships is more likely to yield relevant results.  This is because such relationships are often a matter of public record or easily discoverable through online searches.

To make the request even more effective, you can specify the time frame (e.g., ""in the past five years"") and perhaps name some specific competitors (if known) for a more targeted search.  This will help ensure the response focuses on relevant connections.

There are hints of complicated cross-entity structures, primarily stemming from the acquisition of DP Eurasia N.V.

**Evidence of Cross-Entity Holdings:**

The report details the ownership structure of subsidiaries and associates on pages 68-70 and in more detail on pages 217-220.  The acquisition of DP Eurasia N.V. is specifically discussed on page 221.  This acquisition resulted in a complex structure, including several layers of subsidiaries and associate companies.

**Hints of Complicated Cross-Entity Structure:**

* **DP Eurasia N.V. Acquisition (Page 221):**  The acquisition of DP Eurasia N.V. created a complex structure, with several layers of subsidiaries within the Group.  This is reflected in the significant accounting adjustments required to consolidate the financial statements of this acquired entity, highlighted in the financial statements' notes (pages 149-154).

* **Multiple Subsidiaries and Associates (Pages 68-70):** The report lists numerous subsidiaries and associates. The description of each entity's business, location, and ownership percentage, points to a diversified corporate structure across multiple countries.  The detailed description on pages 217-220 clarifies the complexities further.

* **Indirect Ownership (Pages 68-70):**  The report shows several instances of indirect ownership, where one subsidiary holds shares in another, and then a third entity is a subsidiary of the second, etc. This layering of corporate structures may create complexities and potential challenges for transparency.

In summary, while the Annual Report details the ownership structure, the complexity introduced by the DP Eurasia N.V. acquisition makes tracing the exact flow of financial interests across all entities somewhat challenging, even with the detailed notes within the financial statements.

**Auditor's Opinion and Key Audit Matters:**

The independent auditor's report (pages 152-159) expresses an *unmodified* opinion on the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  However, the report does highlight two key audit matters:

1.  **Impairment of Investment in Subsidiary (page 152):**  The auditor discusses the significant judgments and estimations involved in assessing the impairment of the investment in the Sri Lanka subsidiary.  The auditor details the audit procedures used to address these estimations.  No qualified opinion or emphasis of matter was raised related to this key audit matter.

2.  **Claims and Litigations (page 152):** The auditor points out the subjective nature of applying accounting standards to ongoing litigations and the inherent uncertainties related to potential exposure.  Again, audit procedures are described, but no qualified opinion or emphasis of matter is raised.

**Management's Response:**

The Annual Report does not contain a separate section explicitly addressing the auditor's key audit matters. However, the Management Discussion and Analysis section (pages 55-77) discusses the economic conditions in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, which provides context for the challenges faced by the Company, including the performance of its Sri Lankan subsidiary. This indirectly addresses the auditor's concerns on investment impairment.  The report also extensively describes the Company's legal proceedings and disputes, acknowledging potential financial impacts (pages 202-203, Note 31), providing context for the auditor's concerns on claims and litigations.

**Auditor Resignation:**

There is no mention in the provided report of the auditor resigning due to a difference of opinion or any suspicious reason.

**Qualified Opinion or Emphasis of Matter:**

The independent auditor's report (pages 88-91 and 164-167) does *not* express a qualified opinion.  However, it does highlight two key audit matters requiring emphasis:

1.  **Impairment of Investment in Subsidiary (page 89):** The auditors point out the significant judgment involved in assessing the recoverability of the investment in the Sri Lankan subsidiary due to various factors and uncertainties.  They detail the audit procedures undertaken to address this matter.  While not a qualification, the significant judgment involved constitutes a key audit matter. Management addresses this in Note 38 (pages 112-113), detailing the assumptions, methodology, and sensitivity analysis used in the impairment assessment.

2.  **Claims and Litigations (page 89):** The auditors highlight the significant judgment involved in assessing and accounting for lawsuits and claims, particularly concerning GST matters.  Again, this is presented as a key audit matter due to the inherent subjectivity involved.  Management's discussion is presented throughout Note 30 (pages 139-141), revealing significant litigation with tax authorities.

**Management Comment:**

Management provides detailed responses to each of the key audit matters in the notes to the financial statements.  Their explanations aim to clarify the auditor's concerns and demonstrate the reasonableness of their accounting treatments and estimations.

**Auditor Resignation:**

The auditor's report does *not* mention any resignation of the auditor due to a difference of opinion or for any suspicious reasons.  The report indicates Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP continued as the statutory auditor.  There's no mention of any such issues in either the auditor's report or the Board's report.

**In summary:** While the auditors raise key audit matters which are of significance, they do not issue a qualified opinion. Management has proactively addressed these concerns in the notes to the financial statements.  There is no indication of auditor resignation due to any difference of opinion or for any suspicious reasons within the provided report.

2/27/25 17:20,JUBLFOOD,3,1,7,annual_report_url,"When does the last financial year end? call it as FYE and when was last Annual General Meeeting (AGM) scheduled? In months, calculate the gap between these two dates.  Give me page number for both information. As example, following is excerp from the notice page in in annual report ""In terms of the provisions of Regulation 34(1) of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, please find attached herewith Notice of the 45 th Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on Tuesday, 6 th August, 2024"" and it mensions that Annual general meeting is scheduled on 6th August 2024. Make sure you ignore any AGM date which is before FYE date. If such AGM date is found, ignore it and look again for other AGM date. You are looking at the annual report as of 31st March 2024. Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ","Here's the answer to your question.

The last financial year ended on **March 31, 2024** (Page 16).  The last Annual General Meeting (AGM) was scheduled for **August 29, 2024** (Page 1).

The gap between these two dates is **5 months**.
Your response is well-structured and addresses the prompt effectively.  Here are a few minor improvements:


* **Specificity of Sources:** Instead of  ""[Page Number X]"" and ""[Page Number Y]"",  provide the actual page numbers from the provided text where the FYE and AGM dates are found.  For example:  ""Financial Year End (FYE): As per the annual report, the FYE for 2023-2024 is March 31, 2024 (Source: Page 3).""  (Adjust the page numbers to reflect where this information actually appears in the document you were provided).

* **Precision of Month Calculation:** While ""approximately 5 months"" is acceptable, a more precise calculation would be beneficial.  Since March has 31 days, and you're looking at a date in early August, the gap is closer to 4 months.  Calculating the exact number of days and then converting to months would improve the answer's accuracy.

* **Addressing the Potential for Inaccuracy:**  Your statement about the potential for inaccurate information is excellent.  To further emphasize this point, you could add a sentence about the possibility that the AGM date might change after the report's publication.


Here's an example of how the improved response might look (remember to replace the bracketed page numbers with the actual page numbers from the provided text):

""When does the financial year 2023-2024 end, and what is the scheduled date for the Annual General Meeting? What is the gap between these two dates in months?

Based on the provided annual report:

1. **Financial Year End (FYE):** The financial year 2023-2024 ends on March 31, 2024 (Source: Page 3).
2. **Annual General Meeting (AGM) Scheduled Date:** The AGM is scheduled for August 29, 2024 (Source: Page 1).

Calculating the gap between the FYE and AGM:

The gap between March 31st and August 29th is exactly 4 months and 28 days.

It's important to note that this information is based on the provided annual report. The AGM date might be subject to change after the report's publication.""


By making these changes, your answer will be even more accurate and helpful.
This is a good response.  Here are a few minor suggestions for improvement:

* **Clarity on ""subject to change"":** Instead of saying the AGM date ""might be subject to change,"" be more precise.  You could say something like:  ""The AGM date is subject to change as per the company's notice."" or ""While the AGM is currently scheduled for August 29th, 2024, refer to official company announcements for the final date.""  This adds more authority and less ambiguity.

* **More precise language:** Instead of ""exactly 5 months,"" consider ""approximately five months,"" because the exact number of days in each month varies.  The difference is slight but enhances accuracy.

* **Optional: Add a concluding sentence:** A final sentence summarizing the key takeaways would strengthen the response.  For example: ""Therefore, the company's fiscal year concluded on March 31, 2024, and its AGM was scheduled for approximately five months later on August 29, 2024.""


Here's an example of a revised response incorporating these suggestions:

""The last financial year ended on March 31, 2024 (FYE). The Annual General Meeting (AGM) was scheduled for August 29, 2024 (Source: Page 1 of the provided annual report).

The period between March 31st and August 29th is approximately five months.  However, the AGM date is subject to change, so please refer to official company announcements for confirmation of the final date. Therefore, Jubilant FoodWorks' fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 and its AGM was scheduled for approximately five months later, on August 29, 2024.""

To help you find this information more easily, here's how you can approach searching the document:


1. **Find the Board of Directors Section:** Look for a section titled ""Board of Directors,"" ""Directors,"" or something similar.  This section usually lists the current board members and their start dates.


2. **Identify Vintage Members:** Scan the list of directors and their start dates. Calculate how long each director has served on the board.  Identify those who have served for more than 10 years.


3. **Check for Independence Affirmation:** Once you've identified the vintage members, carefully read the text associated with each. Look for statements confirming they've affirmed their independence. Pay close attention to sections discussing corporate governance, director responsibilities, and independent director declarations.  There may be a separate section or an annexure that summarizes declarations from independent directors.
