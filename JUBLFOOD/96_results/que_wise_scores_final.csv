0,2025-03-07 21:40:18,JUBLFOOD,1,4,2,"According to the Jubilant FoodWorks Corporate Governance report (page 2), all directors are marked as non-permanent board members, except for Shyam S. Bhartia, Hari S. Bhartia, and Shamit Bhartia, who were appointed before the five-year threshold. There is no information explicitly stating that any of these permanent board members belong to a lender group."
1,2025-03-07 21:40:27,JUBLFOOD,1,7,2,"The period between March 31st and August 29th is approximately five months, which falls within the category of less than 4 months. Although the exact number of days can be calculated to be 151 days, for the purpose of scoring, the provided information is sufficient to determine that the gap is less than 4 months. The justification for this score is based on the fact that the company's fiscal year concluded on March 31, 2024, and its AGM was scheduled for approximately five months later on August 29, 2024."
2,2025-03-07 21:40:42,JUBLFOOD,1,10,2,"Based on the provided reports (Corporate Governance report, page 3; Annual Report, pages 11 and 69-70), there is no mention of linkages between key management personnel or board members and competitors. Additionally, the report does not reveal any direct linkages between key management personnel or board members and key suppliers or vendors. The report includes a section on stakeholder engagement (page 18) and a discussion of related party transactions (pages 69-70, and 208-211 in the consolidated financial statements section), but these sections do not reveal any such relationships. Overall, this suggests that Jubilant FoodWorks Limited has adequate mechanisms in place to manage potential conflicts of interest."
3,2025-03-07 21:40:54,JUBLFOOD,1,12,2,"The total royalty revenue (₹0.002088 crores) is significantly smaller than the company's profit (₹400.07 crores). The royalty income represents a tiny fraction of the overall profit, with a ratio of 0.00052% (approximately), which is less than 0.1, making it eligible for a score of 2."
4,2025-03-07 21:41:05,JUBLFOOD,1,16,2,"Based on the Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 (page 106), the shareholding of promoters is explicitly stated. The report does not indicate a pyramidal holding structure that disproportionately increases promoter voting power. The report shows that promoters held 41.94% of the shares as of March 31, 2024. There is no mention of any structure that would give promoters more voting power than this percentage. While the report provides information on cross-entity holdings and hints at complicated structures, it does not give the impression of being completely opaque or potentially violating minority stakeholders' rights."
5,2025-03-07 21:41:28,JUBLFOOD,2,18,2,"Although the Memorandum and Articles of Association does not contain information on workplace accidents or labor fatalities, the Integrated Annual Report for the year ended 31st March 2024 provides details of safety-related incidents. The report mentions the number of employee accidents, including Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR), Total recordable work-related injuries, Number of fatalities, and High consequence work-related injury or ill-health (excluding fatalities). These statistics are publicly disclosed and demonstrate the company's commitment to transparency in health, safety, and welfare matters."
6,2025-03-07 21:41:35,JUBLFOOD,2,19,1,"Although the provided text does not explicitly state the name of the policy, it mentions that the company has adopted a policy in compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 ('POSH Act') as mentioned on page 72 of the annual report. The policy includes periodic sessions to build awareness on the subject and an Internal Complaints Committee ('ICC') is constituted to address complaints regarding sexual harassment. While the name of the policy itself is not explicitly stated, it appears that the company has publicly disclosed its prevention of sexual harassment policy."
7,2025-03-07 21:41:40,JUBLFOOD,2,20,0,"No information available. The content does not provide any direct references or sources to Jubilant FoodWorks' supplier/contractor selection policies and practices, vendor/supplier management standards, or specific policy names. Although the approach of asking targeted questions is recommended, it's unclear if the company has policies for either supplier/vendor management or selection."
8,2025-03-07 21:41:53,JUBLFOOD,2,21,1,"The Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Integrated Annual Report (March 31, 2024) indicates that the company is generally regular in depositing undisputed statutory dues (page 241), and there's discussion of trade payables having an average settlement term of six months (page 198) and trade receivables with an average collection period of around 51 days (page 109). Although it does not indicate any *delayed* payments, the company has delayed payment to suppliers as mentioned in its Annual Report for the year ended March 31st, 2023 (notes to the financial statements, page 196-197) and Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022 (trade payables are normally settled within 30-60 days, page 134, Note 18)."

10,2025-03-07 21:42:07,JUBLFOOD,2,23,2,"The calculation for the financial year ending March 31, 2024 shows that CSR spending represented 2.49% of the consolidated profit. For the financial year ending March 31st, 2023, CSR spending represented 2.55% of their profit after tax. For the financial year ending March 31, 2022, CSR spending represented 2.009% of its average net profit for the three preceding years. Since the ratio of CSR spending to net profit is more than 0.02 for all three years, the score is 2."
11,2025-03-07 21:45:37,JUBLFOOD,3,28,2,"The independent auditor's report (both consolidated and standalone) expresses an unqualified opinion on the financial statements, without any matter of emphasis or qualification. The report highlights two key audit matters: impairment of investment in subsidiary and claims and litigations. However, no qualified opinion or emphasis of matter was raised related to these key audit matters. Management has addressed these concerns indirectly through their discussions in the Management Discussion and Analysis section."
12,2025-03-07 21:45:45,JUBLFOOD,3,32,0,"No information available. Although it's generally known that companies typically have policies in place to govern transactions with related parties, specific details on Jubilant FoodWorks' policy, including definitions of ordinary business and materiality thresholds, are not available.

13,2025-03-07 21:45:54,JUBLFOOD,3,36,1,"Although the shareholding pattern is transparently disclosed, the annual report does not explicitly list the top 10 shareholder names. However, it provides a breakdown of the shareholding percentage by category (e.g., Promoter Holding, Mutual Funds, Banks, etc.). This information can be found on page 106 of the Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24. Source: Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24, page 106."
14,2025-03-07 21:46:00,JUBLFOOD,3,37,0,"Shareholding information is not consistently provided across all Board members, and it is not available at all for Key Management Personnel. Although the report provides information on shareholdings for individual Board members, such as Shyam S. Bhartia holding 0 shares (Page 68), this information is not consistently disclosed for all members of the Board. Moreover, the report does not provide any shareholding information for Key Management Personnel at all, leaving no transparency in their ownership stakes. Therefore, a score of 0 is awarded as per the scoring criteria."
15,2025-03-07 21:46:10,JUBLFOOD,3,38,2,"The company has a dividend distribution policy and publicly available information about its dividend payout ratio. The policy does not specify a target payout ratio but provides guidance on future dividend payouts. Additionally, there have been no deviations from the policy in the past three years or the rationale for any deviation has been clearly provided. Specifically, the annual report states that the Board recommends a dividend of ₹1.20 (60% of face value) per equity share for FY2024, subject to shareholder approval. Although there was a deviation from the payout ratio in FY2023 (22.43%), it is explicitly stated in the consolidated financial statements and does not contradict the policy. Overall, the company's dividend distribution policy meets the criteria for a score of 2."
16,2025-03-07 21:46:27,JUBLFOOD,3,44,2,"The information provided shows that both board members and key management personnel have their qualifications, field of expertise, and number of years of experience mentioned.

Bhartia (Chairman & Director) has a Bachelors' degree in Commerce from St. Xavier's College, Calcutta University, over four decades of experience in pharmaceuticals, contract R&D, proprietary novel drugs, life science ingredients, agri products, performance polymers, food service (QSR), food, auto, consulting in aerospace and oilfield services. Similarly, Mr. Sameer Khetarpal (CEO & Managing Director) has an MBA from ISB Hyderabad and MS (Chemical Engineering) from Lamar University, Texas, with 25+ years of experience in e-commerce, CPG, and management consulting. For key management personnel, Ms. Deepti Gupta (Executive Vice President, Human Resource & Administration) has a PGDM in HR from MDI Gurgaon, with 18+ years of experience in human resources across various sectors. The same pattern is observed for other board members and key management personnel. References: Jubilant FoodWorks Limited's Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2024 (Pages 44-47)."
17,2025-03-07 21:46:31,JUBLFOOD,3,45,2,"Based on my review of Jubilant Foodworks Limited's Integrated Annual Report (2023-24), there is no mention of any directors, board members, or key management personnel being fined by regulatory bodies or stock exchanges as of March 31st, 2024. I have thoroughly examined the relevant sections, including the Corporate Governance Report and the Directors' Responsibility Statement. There was no such information provided."

Although some individual attendance ratios are 100%, others like Berjis Minoo Desai's 43% and Aashti Bhartia's 83.33% bring down the overall average."
19,2025-03-07 21:48:43,JUBLFOOD,4,49,2,"The board met more than 4 times in the financial year, as stated in The Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Annual Report (31st March 2024) on page 84, which specifies that the Board of Directors held seven meetings during the fiscal year. This meets the criteria for a score of 2."
20,2025-03-07 21:48:53,JUBLFOOD,4,51,2,"The Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Board collectively possesses strong expertise (more than 10 years) in at least 3 areas: General Management, Legal, and Marketing. Additionally, at least one member has prior working experience in the major industry in which the company operates (food service), as mentioned on page 11 of the annual report."
21,2025-03-07 21:48:59,JUBLFOOD,4,52,2,"The gender ratio of independent board members for Jubilant FoodWorks Limited is more than 0.3 (40%). As per the document 'Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24', page 44, there are 2 female independent directors out of a total of 5 independent directors, which corresponds to a gender ratio of 2/5 = 0.4 or 40%. This meets the criteria for a score of 2."
22,2025-03-07 21:49:08,JUBLFOOD,4,53,2,"According to the Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Integrated Annual Report for the year ended 31st March 2024, on page 31 under the 'People and Communities' section, it is stated that 34% of the total workforce were women. With a total number of employees at the end of the year being 34,120, this translates to 11,608 female employees (34% of 34,120). As per the scoring criteria, since the female-to-total workforce ratio is more than or equal to 30%, I am awarding a score of 2. The report does not provide information on the exact number of male employees, but given the total number of employees and the percentage of women, it can be inferred that there are at least 22,512 male employees (34,120 - 11,608). Reference: Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Integrated Annual Report for the year ended 31st March 2024, page 31."
23,2025-03-07 21:49:16,JUBLFOOD,4,54,1,"As per Jubilant FoodWorks Limited's Integrated Annual Report 2023-24, the company has a non-executive chairman who is not also a promoter (page 44). Additionally, as of March 31, 2024, 55% of the Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Board of Directors are Independent Directors (page 37), which meets the criteria for a score of 1. Since there is no information provided about the board's annual independence affirmation policy or vintage members on the board, I could not further assess the company's board independence."
24,2025-03-07 21:49:24,JUBLFOOD,4,55,1,"The committee formation meets most criteria. However, there is a violation of Criteria 3 as Shyam S. Bhartia and Hari S. Bhartia have served on the Board for more than 10 years. Despite this, the Audit Committee has 5 independent members, which satisfies Criteria 2. The Audit Committee also has more than or equal to 3 members, meeting Criteria 1. Since only one criteria is violated (Criteria 3), the score is 1."
25,2025-03-07 21:49:32,JUBLFOOD,4,63,0,"The CEO compensation for Sameer Khetarpal for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, is ₹66.23 million, which is more than 0.05 of net profits (₹4,007.52 million) as calculated by the ratio R2 = CEO Compensation / Net Profit = ₹66.23 million / ₹4,007.52 million = 0.0165. According to the calculation, R2 is approximately 1.65%, which is less than 0.05. Therefore, it is not acceptable that Total compensation of CEO is more than 0.05 of net profits (as per page 47 and 67 of Jubilant FoodWorks Limited's Integrated Annual Report 2023-24)."
