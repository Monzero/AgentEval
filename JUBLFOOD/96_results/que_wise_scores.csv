Bhartia) is marked as permanent board members but there is no explicit information stating that they are representatives of lenders. The report does not provide any information about the lender group or their collective characteristics."
2025-02-28 21:07:51,JUBLFOOD,1,7,2,"The gap between the FYE (March 31, 2024) and AGM (August 29, 2024) is approximately 5 months, which falls within the category of less than 120 days. The information is provided in the annual report on page 1 for the AGM date and page 16 for the FYE date. The calculation of the gap is precise, taking into account the exact number of days between March 31st and August 29th. Additionally, it's important to note that the AGM date is subject to change as per the company's notice, which adds an element of transparency to the report."
2025-02-28 21:08:05,JUBLFOOD,1,10,2,"Based on my analysis of the provided Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Annual Report (March 31, 2024), there is no mention of linkages between key management personnel or board members and suppliers or vendors. The report does include a section on stakeholder engagement (page 18) and a discussion of related party transactions (pages 69-70, and 208-211 in the consolidated financial statements section), but these sections do not reveal any such relationships."
2025-02-28 21:08:16,JUBLFOOD,1,12,2,"The ratio of the royalty payments to the related parties to the company's profit is calculated as ₹0.002088 crores / ₹400.07 crores, which is less than 0.1. The justification is that the total amount of royalty transactions (₹20.88) is significantly smaller than the company's profit (₹400.07 crores), and the royalty income constitutes a very small fraction of the overall profit. The reference for this calculation is the text itself, specifically points 2 and 4."
2025-02-28 21:08:29,JUBLFOOD,1,16,2,"The Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 explicitly states the shareholding of promoters at 41.94%, which does not indicate a pyramidal holding structure that disproportionately increases promoter voting power. The report also provides significant information regarding ownership and control of subsidiaries and associates, including percentages of ownership. While there are hints of complicated cross-entity structures, primarily stemming from the acquisition of DP Eurasia N.V., the report itself does not explicitly state that the ultimate beneficiary cannot be fully determined. The detailed notes within the financial statements (pages 149-154) clarify some complexities, making it possible to trace the flow of financial interests across entities without assumptions."
2025-02-28 21:08:39,JUBLFOOD,2,18,2,"Jubilant FoodWorks Limited provides information on workplace accidents and fatalities in its Integrated Annual Report for the year ended 31st March 2024, specifically highlighting Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR), Total recordable work-related injuries, Number of fatalities, and High consequence work-related injury or ill-health. The report notes that these figures are work-related. Although I couldn't access the company's website to find the policies, the provided document does not contain information regarding workplace accidents or labor fatalities. Therefore, considering the publicly disclosed safety statistics and absence of relevant information in the Memorandum and Articles of Association, I scored this 2, indicating that the company has publicly disclosed its health and safety policies and provided information on the number of employee accidents."
2025-02-28 21:08:47,JUBLFOOD,2,19,1,"The document focuses on the company's Memorandum and Articles of Association, but it does contain information about the company's policies and mechanisms to prevent sexual harassment at the workplace. Specifically, the annual report (page 72) mentions that the company has adopted a policy in compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 ('POSH Act'). This information suggests that the policy regarding sexual harassment is publicly disclosed. Although the name of the policy itself is not explicitly stated in the provided text, the report notes that periodic sessions were conducted to build awareness on the subject and that an Internal Complaints Committee ('ICC') was constituted to address complaints regarding sexual harassment. Hence, a score of 1 is justified."

The provided content states that it's not possible to access external websites or specific files online, including the Jubilant FoodWorks website.

However, the report indicates that the company is generally regular in depositing undisputed statutory dues (page 241). There's also discussion of trade payables having an average settlement term of six months (page 198) and trade receivables with an average collection period of around 51 days (page 109). These details, however, do not indicate any *delayed* payments. Additionally, the CRISIL credit rating report does not mention any delayed repayments to lenders, creditors, or suppliers. Although there is no information indicating delayed payment to lenders, it is noted that the company has delayed payment to its suppliers and vendors (referencing the reports for 2022 and 2023)."
2025-02-28 21:09:10,JUBLFOOD,2,22,0,"I could not find any explicit mention of ethics policy or code of conduct in the provided document, Memorandum and Articles of Association of Jubilant FoodWorks Limited. The document only outlines the company's objectives and legal structure but does not delve into internal policies or procedures related to ethical conduct, conflict resolution, or anti-corruption/anti-bribery measures. It is impossible to definitively say whether the company demonstrates a commitment to strong ethical practices or has specific procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest, third-party interactions, or disciplinary action for ethics violations."
2025-02-28 21:09:19,JUBLFOOD,2,23,2,"Jubilant FoodWorks Limited spent ₹99.60 million on CSR activities in the financial year ending March 31, 2024, which represents 2.49% of their consolidated profit of ₹4,007.52 million (Source: Jubilant FoodWorks Limited, Integrated Annual Report 2023-24, page 64). This percentage is greater than 0.02 times of their profit, so we score it as 2. In the previous years, the company's CSR spending as a percentage of their profit after tax was also above 0.02% (2.55% in FY 2023 and 2.009% in FY 2022)."

Although it does not explicitly list the top 10 shareholder names, it notes that this information can be obtained from additional filings made with the relevant stock exchanges. Therefore, while the company provides some transparency on its shareholding pattern, it falls short of disclosing the actual names of the top 10 shareholders.

2025-02-28 21:15:43,JUBLFOOD,4,49,2,"The Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Annual Report (31st March 2024) clearly indicates that the Board of Directors held seven meetings during the fiscal year, which exceeds the threshold of four meetings. According to the report, page 84 states: 'The Board of Directors held seven meetings during the fiscal year.' This information is sourced from the annual report and can be verified accordingly."
2025-02-28 21:15:55,JUBLFOOD,4,51,2,"The Jubilant FoodWorks Board collectively possesses strong expertise (more than 10 years each) in at least three areas: General Management, Legal, and Marketing. Additionally, at least one member has prior working experience in the food service industry, which is relevant to the company's major industry. Specifically, Mr. Hari S. Bhartia and Mr. Shyam S. Bhartia have over 39 years of experience in the food service industry (Reference: Annexure A, page 11), while Mr. Sameer Khetarpal has 25+ years of experience in sectors including food service (Reference: Annual Report, page ?). The presence of experts from these areas, along with relevant industrial experience, demonstrates the board's collective expertise and relevance to the company's industry."
2025-02-28 21:15:59,JUBLFOOD,4,52,2,"The gender ratio of independent board members at Jubilant FoodWorks Limited as of March 31, 2024 is 0.4 or 40%. Since this is greater than 0.3, we score a 2. The calculation is based on the provided document 'Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24', page 44."
2025-02-28 21:16:05,JUBLFOOD,4,53,1,"The female to total workforce ratio in Jubilant FoodWorks Limited for the year ended 31st March 2024 is calculated by dividing the number of female employees (34% of total workforce) by the total number of employees. This gives us a ratio of 0.34 or approximately 0.17 (rounded to two decimal places). As this falls between 0.1 (inclusive) and 0.3, we assign a score of 1. Reference: Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Integrated Annual Report for the year ended 31st March 2024, page 31"
2025-02-28 21:16:11,JUBLFOOD,4,54,2,"As of March 31, 2024, 55% of the Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Board of Directors are Independent Directors (found on page 37 of their Integrated Annual Report 2023-24). Since the chairman is non-executive and not a promoter, this meets the criteria for independence. The report does not indicate that the chairman is also a promoter."
2025-02-28 21:16:20,JUBLFOOD,4,55,1,"The committee formation does not fully meet our criteria. Criteria 2 (Audit committee and NRC committee members should be independent) is satisfied as all Audit Committee members are independent, but Criteria 3 (members on either Audit committee or NRC committee should not be on board for more than 10 years) is violated because Shyam S. Bhartia and Hari S. Bhartia have served on the Board for more than 10 years as of March 31, 2024. Only one criteria is violated, so the score is 1."
2025-02-28 21:16:27,JUBLFOOD,4,63,2,"The CEO compensation for Sameer Khetarpal for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, is ₹66.23 million (found on page 47 of the annual report). The consolidated net profit for the same period is ₹4,007.52 million (found on page 67 of the annual report). Calculating the ratio R2 (CEO Compensation / Net Profit), we get: R2 = ₹66.23 million / ₹4,007.52 million = 0.0165 or approximately 1.65%. Since this ratio is less than 0.05, it meets our criteria for CEO compensation being fine."
2025-03-07 21:40:18,JUBLFOOD,1,4,2,"According to the Jubilant FoodWorks Corporate Governance report (page 2), all directors are marked as non-permanent board members, except for Shyam S. Bhartia, Hari S. Bhartia, and Shamit Bhartia, who were appointed before the five-year threshold. There is no information explicitly stating that any of these permanent board members belong to a lender group."
2025-03-07 21:40:27,JUBLFOOD,1,7,2,"The period between March 31st and August 29th is approximately five months, which falls within the category of less than 4 months. Although the exact number of days can be calculated to be 151 days, for the purpose of scoring, the provided information is sufficient to determine that the gap is less than 4 months. The justification for this score is based on the fact that the company's fiscal year concluded on March 31, 2024, and its AGM was scheduled for approximately five months later on August 29, 2024."
2025-03-07 21:40:42,JUBLFOOD,1,10,2,"Based on the provided reports (Corporate Governance report, page 3; Annual Report, pages 11 and 69-70), there is no mention of linkages between key management personnel or board members and competitors. Additionally, the report does not reveal any direct linkages between key management personnel or board members and key suppliers or vendors. The report includes a section on stakeholder engagement (page 18) and a discussion of related party transactions (pages 69-70, and 208-211 in the consolidated financial statements section), but these sections do not reveal any such relationships. Overall, this suggests that Jubilant FoodWorks Limited has adequate mechanisms in place to manage potential conflicts of interest."
2025-03-07 21:40:54,JUBLFOOD,1,12,2,"The total royalty revenue (₹0.002088 crores) is significantly smaller than the company's profit (₹400.07 crores). The royalty income represents a tiny fraction of the overall profit, with a ratio of 0.00052% (approximately), which is less than 0.1, making it eligible for a score of 2."

The report does not indicate a pyramidal holding structure that disproportionately increases promoter voting power. The report shows that promoters held 41.94% of the shares as of March 31, 2024. There is no mention of any structure that would give promoters more voting power than this percentage. While the report provides information on cross-entity holdings and hints at complicated structures, it does not give the impression of being completely opaque or potentially violating minority stakeholders' rights."

The report mentions the number of employee accidents, including Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR), Total recordable work-related injuries, Number of fatalities, and High consequence work-related injury or ill-health (excluding fatalities).

For the financial year ending March 31, 2022, CSR spending represented 2.009% of its average net profit for the three preceding years. Since the ratio of CSR spending to net profit is more than 0.02 for all three years, the score is 2."
2025-03-07 21:45:37,JUBLFOOD,3,28,2,"The independent auditor's report (both consolidated and standalone) expresses an unqualified opinion on the financial statements, without any matter of emphasis or qualification. The report highlights two key audit matters: impairment of investment in subsidiary and claims and litigations. However, no qualified opinion or emphasis of matter was raised related to these key audit matters. Management has addressed these concerns indirectly through their discussions in the Management Discussion and Analysis section."

Although the report provides information on shareholdings for individual Board members, such as Shyam S. Bhartia holding 0 shares (Page 68), this information is not consistently disclosed for all members of the Board. Moreover, the report does not provide any shareholding information for Key Management Personnel at all, leaving no transparency in their ownership stakes. Therefore, a score of 0 is awarded as per the scoring criteria."

Specifically, the annual report states that the Board recommends a dividend of ₹1.20 (60% of face value) per equity share for FY2024, subject to shareholder approval. Although there was a deviation from the payout ratio in FY2023 (22.43%), it is explicitly stated in the consolidated financial statements and does not contradict the policy.

Although some individual attendance ratios are 100%, others like Berjis Minoo Desai's 43% and Aashti Bhartia's 83.33% bring down the overall average."

This meets the criteria for a score of 2."
2025-03-07 21:48:53,JUBLFOOD,4,51,2,"The Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Board collectively possesses strong expertise (more than 10 years) in at least 3 areas: General Management, Legal, and Marketing.

As per the document 'Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24', page 44, there are 2 female independent directors out of a total of 5 independent directors, which corresponds to a gender ratio of 2/5 = 0.4 or 40%.

2025-03-07 21:49:08,JUBLFOOD,4,53,2,"According to the Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Integrated Annual Report for the year ended 31st March 2024, on page 31 under the 'People and Communities' section, it is stated that 34% of the total workforce were women. With a total number of employees at the end of the year being 34,120, this translates to 11,608 female employees (34% of 34,120). As per the scoring criteria, since the female-to-total workforce ratio is more than or equal to 30%, I am awarding a score of 2. The report does not provide information on the exact number of male employees, but given the total number of employees and the percentage of women, it can be inferred that there are at least 22,512 male employees (34,120 - 11,608). Reference: Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Integrated Annual Report for the year ended 31st March 2024, page 31."

Additionally, as of March 31, 2024, 55% of the Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Board of Directors are Independent Directors (page 37), which meets the criteria for a score of 1. Since there is no information provided about the board's annual independence affirmation policy or vintage members on the board, I could not further assess the company's board independence."

Bhartia have served on the Board for more than 10 years. Despite this, the Audit Committee has 5 independent members, which satisfies Criteria 2. The Audit Committee also has more than or equal to 3 members, meeting Criteria 1. Since only one criteria is violated (Criteria 3), the score is 1."
2025-03-07 21:49:32,JUBLFOOD,4,63,0,"The CEO compensation for Sameer Khetarpal for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, is ₹66.23 million, which is more than 0.05 of net profits (₹4,007.52 million) as calculated by the ratio R2 = CEO Compensation / Net Profit = ₹66.23 million / ₹4,007.52 million = 0.0165. According to the calculation, R2 is approximately 1.65%, which is less than 0.05. Therefore, it is not acceptable that Total compensation of CEO is more than 0.05 of net profits (as per page 47 and 67 of Jubilant FoodWorks Limited's Integrated Annual Report 2023-24)."
