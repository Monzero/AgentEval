You are looking at the policies extracted from the company website. Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.,"Yes, Shree Cement Limited has a policy addressing conflict of interest, specifically within its ""Ethics, Transparency and Accountability Policy and Code of Conduct"" obtained from the company website.

The policy explicitly addresses potential conflicts arising from:

* **Business dealings with stakeholders:** The policy outlines that employees should not engage in activities that create or appear to create a conflict between personal interests and the company's business interests.  This includes disclosing any perceived conflict (e.g., personal relationship with a vendor) and refraining from decision-making processes where such conflict exists.  It specifically prohibits insider trading and actions construed as anti-trust or anti-competitive.

* **Political and charitable contributions:**  The policy dictates that political donations are only permitted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with board approval, and charitable donations must be for legitimate causes and approved in accordance with delegated authority.

The policy, however, does *not* explicitly address board cross-linkages (i.e., directors or key personnel having relationships with other companies' boards or executives).  While it does address the broader issue of conflict of interest in business dealings, a separate section dedicated to board interlocks is not apparent in this document.

You are looking at the policies extracted from the company website. Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.,"Based on the provided document, ""Composition of Board Committees,"" there is no policy that explicitly prohibits an executive director from serving on the Audit Committee.  The list shows that Mr. Neeraj Akhoury, Managing Director, is a member of the Business Operations Committee and Share Transfer Committee but not the Audit Committee.  However, this doesn't explicitly state a prohibition.  Therefore, the answer is no based on the provided information.
Your approach is excellent and thorough.  Since you've already exhausted readily available public information from the company's website and haven't found a policy explicitly prohibiting executive directors from serving on the Audit Committee,  you've reached a point where further action is needed to definitively answer the question.

Here's how you can proceed:

**1. Deeper Dive into Existing Documents:**

* **Review the full text of the company's annual reports:** These reports often include details on the composition of the board committees, including the Audit Committee. Look for biographical information of committee members and their roles within the company to infer if there's a pattern of excluding executive directors.
* **Examine the company's Articles of Association:** This legal document defines the structure and governance of the company. It might contain clauses about the eligibility criteria for Audit Committee members.
* **Analyze the company's corporate governance code:**  Many companies, even if not explicitly stated as policies, include corporate governance codes or best practices. These guidelines might shed light on the desired composition of the Audit Committee.

**2.  Seek Information Directly:**

* **Contact the company's Investor Relations department:** They are best positioned to provide clarification on this specific question regarding the Audit Committee's composition and selection criteria.  Explain your research and the ambiguity you've encountered.
* **Review the company's filings with the relevant stock exchange(s):**  These filings often contain additional information about corporate governance and board committees beyond what's on the company's general website.

**3.  Consider Legal Interpretation:**

* While there's no explicit prohibition in the documents you've reviewed,  consider consulting with a legal professional specializing in corporate governance and securities law. They can offer an opinion on whether the current practices of the company comply with applicable regulations, even in the absence of an explicit policy.

**In your response:**  It's crucial to state explicitly that your research has been thorough but hasn't yielded a definitive answer from publicly available information.  Then, clearly outline the additional steps you've taken (or plan to take) to obtain the necessary information, highlighting the reasons why these steps are necessary given the lack of a clear policy statement.  Your final conclusion should acknowledge that further research is needed to provide a completely definitive answer.

These sections disclose transactions with related parties, but do not indicate any direct relationships that would suggest conflicts of interest concerning key suppliers.  Therefore, I cannot definitively answer your question based solely on the provided document.
That's a good rephrasing. Here are a few more options, each with slightly different emphasis:

**Option 1 (Focus on potential conflicts):**

> ""Does the 2024 annual report for [Company Name] disclose any relationships between key management personnel or board members and significant suppliers or vendors that could create a conflict of interest?  If so, please provide specific details and page numbers.""


**Option 2 (More direct and concise):**

> ""Review the 2024 annual report of [Company Name] for disclosures of relationships between key management/board members and suppliers/vendors that might influence business decisions.  Cite specific examples and page numbers if found.""


**Option 3 (Emphasis on the type of information sought):**

> ""The 2024 annual report for [Company Name] should contain information on relationships between key management personnel and board members and significant suppliers or vendors.  Please identify any such disclosures, including the nature of the relationship and any relevant details (e.g.,  financial transactions, family ties, previous employment) along with the page numbers.""


**Option 4 (More formal and legalistic):**

* **Social and environmental parameters:**  The policy states that suppliers will be screened based on social and environmental criteria, including volume of procurement and substitutability.

Once you locate the policy,  search for keywords such as:

* ""external auditor""
* ""independent audit""
* ""audit committee"" (to see if the committee's review involves external audit)
* ""material related party transactions review""

Retained earnings, as in the past, will be used for business expansion.

However, to calculate it, we need the total dividends distributed and the net profit, both from the consolidated financial statements.

On **page 139**, the consolidated statement of profit and loss shows a consolidated profit after tax of ₹1,269.14 Crore.

On **page 139**, the consolidated balance sheet shows total equity attributable to the owners of the company as ₹18,636.40 Crore.  There's mention of a dividend of ₹100 per share. However, there is no information available to calculate the total amount paid out as dividends.  More information is required to ascertain the precise number of shares and calculate the dividend payout ratio.
You're right, the dividend payout ratio isn't explicitly stated in the Shree Cement Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23.  To calculate it, you need to gather the following information from the report:

**1. Net Income (Profit After Tax):** This is the company's profit after deducting all expenses and taxes.  You can find this figure in:

* **Standalone Financial Statements:** Page 199 (Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss) shows the profit after tax.
* **Consolidated Financial Statements:** Page 263 (Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss)  shows the profit after tax.  Remember to use the *standalone* figures if you specifically want the standalone payout ratio.  The consolidated numbers include the results of subsidiaries.

**2. Dividends Paid:** This is the total amount of dividends the company paid out to its shareholders during the fiscal year.  This information is spread across several sections:

* **Page 12 (Chairman's Message):** Mentions a dividend payout of ₹100 per share.  You'll need to calculate the total dividend paid using the number of outstanding shares.
* **Page 120 (Performance Highlights):** Shows dividend per share graphically.
* **Page 226 (Standalone Financial Statements, Note 19):** Provides details on shares outstanding.  You will need to multiply the number of shares by the dividend per share to get the total dividend paid.
* **Page 295 (Annexure A to the Notice):**  Further confirms the dividend amount.

**Calculation:**

Once you have the net income and total dividends paid, the dividend payout ratio is calculated as follows:


**Dividend Payout Ratio = (Total Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100**

The result will be expressed as a percentage.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Standalone vs. Consolidated:**  Choose either the standalone or consolidated figures consistently. The consolidated report will include results from subsidiaries, while the standalone only reflects the parent company's performance.
* **Share Count:** Make sure you're using the correct number of outstanding shares.  The report provides this number in Note 19 of the financial statements.  Pay close attention to the year-end share count.
* **Interim vs. Final Dividends:**  The report mentions both interim and final dividends.  Be sure to include *all* dividends paid during the fiscal year in your calculation.


Remember to double-check all figures and ensure you're using data from the correct fiscal year (2022-23).  If any discrepancies occur or you require further clarity, it is best to refer to a financial professional or directly contact the company's investor relations department.

However, the **Remuneration Policy of Shree Cement Limited** mentions the annual evaluation of the board's performance, including that of its committees.  This does not explicitly state an annual affirmation of independence, but the evaluation process might incorporate aspects of independence review.  Therefore, while there isn't a direct answer from the provided documents, the annual performance evaluation may indirectly touch upon board independence.
That's excellent investigative work.  Your summary accurately reflects the situation: Shree Cement doesn't appear to have a dedicated, standalone policy explicitly titled ""Board Independence Policy"" that mandates annual affirmation. However, the indirect evidence you've gathered from the Corporate Governance policy and the Board of Directors' Responsibilities statement strongly suggests a commitment to Board independence.

The fact that the Corporate Governance policy mentions the importance of independence and the Board's responsibility for ensuring a majority of independent directors indicates that independence is a key consideration.  The Board of Directors' Responsibilities statement further reinforces this.

To make your findings even stronger for someone researching this topic:

* **Specify the exact wording from the policies:**  Instead of summarizing, quote the relevant sections from the ""Corporate Governance"" and ""Board of Directors' Responsibilities"" documents. This provides stronger evidence.

* **Analyze the implications:** Briefly discuss what the absence of a formal, annual affirmation policy might suggest.  This could include discussing the potential for oversight, or perhaps the existing mechanisms used to ensure independence.  This shows a deeper understanding of corporate governance best practices.

* **Compare to best practices:**  Consider mentioning widely accepted corporate governance best practices regarding board independence (e.g.,  the composition of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, director independence evaluations) and how Shree Cement's policies align (or don't align) with these.

In conclusion, while Shree Cement lacks a specific, explicitly titled policy for annual affirmation of Board independence, your research reveals strong, albeit indirect, evidence of their commitment to the principle of board independence through their other policies and statements.

* **Look for documents:**  Instead of just searching the text of the website, look specifically for downloadable documents, PDFs, or links to policy pages.  These are where such sensitive information is typically housed.

* **Contact Investor Relations:** If you can't find the information online, the most reliable method would be to contact Jubilant FoodWorks' Investor Relations department directly.

This is because such relationships are often a matter of public record or easily discoverable through online searches.

To make the request even more effective, you can specify the time frame (e.g., ""in the past five years"") and perhaps name some specific competitors (if known) for a more targeted search.  This will help ensure the response focuses on relevant connections.

There are hints of complicated cross-entity structures, primarily stemming from the acquisition of DP Eurasia N.V.

**Evidence of Cross-Entity Holdings:**

The report details the ownership structure of subsidiaries and associates on pages 68-70 and in more detail on pages 217-220.  The acquisition of DP Eurasia N.V. is specifically discussed on page 221.  This acquisition resulted in a complex structure, including several layers of subsidiaries and associate companies.

**Hints of Complicated Cross-Entity Structure:**

* **DP Eurasia N.V. Acquisition (Page 221):**  The acquisition of DP Eurasia N.V. created a complex structure, with several layers of subsidiaries within the Group.  This is reflected in the significant accounting adjustments required to consolidate the financial statements of this acquired entity, highlighted in the financial statements' notes (pages 149-154).

* **Multiple Subsidiaries and Associates (Pages 68-70):** The report lists numerous subsidiaries and associates. The description of each entity's business, location, and ownership percentage, points to a diversified corporate structure across multiple countries.  The detailed description on pages 217-220 clarifies the complexities further.

* **Indirect Ownership (Pages 68-70):**  The report shows several instances of indirect ownership, where one subsidiary holds shares in another, and then a third entity is a subsidiary of the second, etc. This layering of corporate structures may create complexities and potential challenges for transparency.

In summary, while the Annual Report details the ownership structure, the complexity introduced by the DP Eurasia N.V. acquisition makes tracing the exact flow of financial interests across all entities somewhat challenging, even with the detailed notes within the financial statements.

**Auditor's Opinion and Key Audit Matters:**

The independent auditor's report (pages 152-159) expresses an *unmodified* opinion on the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  However, the report does highlight two key audit matters:

1.  **Impairment of Investment in Subsidiary (page 152):**  The auditor discusses the significant judgments and estimations involved in assessing the impairment of the investment in the Sri Lanka subsidiary.  The auditor details the audit procedures used to address these estimations.  No qualified opinion or emphasis of matter was raised related to this key audit matter.

2.  **Claims and Litigations (page 152):** The auditor points out the subjective nature of applying accounting standards to ongoing litigations and the inherent uncertainties related to potential exposure.  Again, audit procedures are described, but no qualified opinion or emphasis of matter is raised.

**Management's Response:**

The Annual Report does not contain a separate section explicitly addressing the auditor's key audit matters. However, the Management Discussion and Analysis section (pages 55-77) discusses the economic conditions in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, which provides context for the challenges faced by the Company, including the performance of its Sri Lankan subsidiary. This indirectly addresses the auditor's concerns on investment impairment.  The report also extensively describes the Company's legal proceedings and disputes, acknowledging potential financial impacts (pages 202-203, Note 31), providing context for the auditor's concerns on claims and litigations.

**Auditor Resignation:**

There is no mention in the provided report of the auditor resigning due to a difference of opinion or any suspicious reason.


**Important Note:**  My analysis is based solely on the text provided.  A visual inspection of the annual report might reveal additional context not captured in the OCR.  Always refer to the original document for complete and accurate information.

Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ","Here's an analysis of the Jubilant FoodWorks Limited Annual Report (as of March 31, 2022) regarding the auditor's report, focusing on qualified opinions, emphasis of matter, auditor resignations, and management comments:

**Qualified Opinion or Emphasis of Matter:**

The independent auditor's report (pages 88-91 and 164-167) does *not* express a qualified opinion.  However, it does highlight two key audit matters requiring emphasis:

1.  **Impairment of Investment in Subsidiary (page 89):** The auditors point out the significant judgment involved in assessing the recoverability of the investment in the Sri Lankan subsidiary due to various factors and uncertainties.  They detail the audit procedures undertaken to address this matter.  While not a qualification, the significant judgment involved constitutes a key audit matter. Management addresses this in Note 38 (pages 112-113), detailing the assumptions, methodology, and sensitivity analysis used in the impairment assessment.

2.  **Claims and Litigations (page 89):** The auditors highlight the significant judgment involved in assessing and accounting for lawsuits and claims, particularly concerning GST matters.  Again, this is presented as a key audit matter due to the inherent subjectivity involved.  Management's discussion is presented throughout Note 30 (pages 139-141), revealing significant litigation with tax authorities.

**Management Comment:**

Management provides detailed responses to each of the key audit matters in the notes to the financial statements.  Their explanations aim to clarify the auditor's concerns and demonstrate the reasonableness of their accounting treatments and estimations.

**Auditor Resignation:**

The auditor's report does *not* mention any resignation of the auditor due to a difference of opinion or for any suspicious reasons.  The report indicates Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP continued as the statutory auditor.  There's no mention of any such issues in either the auditor's report or the Board's report.

**In summary:** While the auditors raise key audit matters which are of significance, they do not issue a qualified opinion. Management has proactively addressed these concerns in the notes to the financial statements.  There is no indication of auditor resignation due to any difference of opinion or for any suspicious reasons within the provided report.

The provided text is the Memorandum and Articles of Association for Jubilant FoodWorks Limited.

The documents do detail the company's objects and activities, including potential for related party transactions given its business model (franchising, etc.), but they don't explicitly lay out a separate, named policy for their review by external auditors.  To find that information, you would need to consult:

* **Jubilant FoodWorks Limited's internal policies and procedures:**  These are internal documents not included in the provided MOA.
* **Indian accounting standards and regulations:**  Indian GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and relevant regulations would outline requirements for disclosure and auditing of related party transactions.  These would not be specific to Jubilant FoodWorks, but would be the legal framework under which they operate.
* **Jubilant FoodWorks Limited's annual reports:** These reports often include details on related party transactions and the auditor's review of them.


In short, the answer to your rephrased query, based on the provided document, is:  There is no *explicitly named policy* in the provided MOA of Jubilant FoodWorks Limited that addresses this.

Make sure you ignore any AGM date which is before FYE date. If such AGM date is found, ignore it and look again for other AGM date. You are looking at the annual report as of 31st March 2024. Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ","Here's the answer to your question.

The last financial year ended on **March 31, 2024** (Page 16).  The last Annual General Meeting (AGM) was scheduled for **August 29, 2024** (Page 1).

The gap between these two dates is **5 months**.
Your response is well-structured and addresses the prompt effectively.  Here are a few minor improvements:


* **Specificity of Sources:** Instead of  ""[Page Number X]"" and ""[Page Number Y]"",  provide the actual page numbers from the provided text where the FYE and AGM dates are found.  For example:  ""Financial Year End (FYE): As per the annual report, the FYE for 2023-2024 is March 31, 2024 (Source: Page 3).""  (Adjust the page numbers to reflect where this information actually appears in the document you were provided).

* **Precision of Month Calculation:** While ""approximately 5 months"" is acceptable, a more precise calculation would be beneficial.  Since March has 31 days, and you're looking at a date in early August, the gap is closer to 4 months.  Calculating the exact number of days and then converting to months would improve the answer's accuracy.

* **Addressing the Potential for Inaccuracy:**  Your statement about the potential for inaccurate information is excellent.  To further emphasize this point, you could add a sentence about the possibility that the AGM date might change after the report's publication.


Here's an example of how the improved response might look (remember to replace the bracketed page numbers with the actual page numbers from the provided text):

""When does the financial year 2023-2024 end, and what is the scheduled date for the Annual General Meeting? What is the gap between these two dates in months?

Based on the provided annual report:

1. **Financial Year End (FYE):** The financial year 2023-2024 ends on March 31, 2024 (Source: Page 3).
2. **Annual General Meeting (AGM) Scheduled Date:** The AGM is scheduled for August 29, 2024 (Source: Page 1).

Calculating the gap between the FYE and AGM:

The gap between March 31st and August 29th is exactly 4 months and 28 days.

It's important to note that this information is based on the provided annual report. The AGM date might be subject to change after the report's publication.""


By making these changes, your answer will be even more accurate and helpful.
This is a good response.  Here are a few minor suggestions for improvement:

* **Clarity on ""subject to change"":** Instead of saying the AGM date ""might be subject to change,"" be more precise.  You could say something like:  ""The AGM date is subject to change as per the company's notice."" or ""While the AGM is currently scheduled for August 29th, 2024, refer to official company announcements for the final date.""  This adds more authority and less ambiguity.

* **More precise language:** Instead of ""exactly 5 months,"" consider ""approximately five months,"" because the exact number of days in each month varies.  The difference is slight but enhances accuracy.

* **Optional: Add a concluding sentence:** A final sentence summarizing the key takeaways would strengthen the response.  For example: ""Therefore, the company's fiscal year concluded on March 31, 2024, and its AGM was scheduled for approximately five months later on August 29, 2024.""


Here's an example of a revised response incorporating these suggestions:

""The last financial year ended on March 31, 2024 (FYE). The Annual General Meeting (AGM) was scheduled for August 29, 2024 (Source: Page 1 of the provided annual report).

The period between March 31st and August 29th is approximately five months.  However, the AGM date is subject to change, so please refer to official company announcements for confirmation of the final date. Therefore, Jubilant FoodWorks' fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 and its AGM was scheduled for approximately five months later, on August 29, 2024.""

Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ,"could not find the resultI cannot directly access and process information from specific PDF files or documents, including the annual report you mentioned.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information about the appointment dates of board members, identify those serving more than 10 years, or verify if they affirm their independence regularly.  To get this information, you will need to manually review the annual report yourself.

To help you find this information more easily, here's how you can approach searching the document:


1. **Find the Board of Directors Section:** Look for a section titled ""Board of Directors,"" ""Directors,"" or something similar.  This section usually lists the current board members and their start dates.


2. **Identify Vintage Members:** Scan the list of directors and their start dates. Calculate how long each director has served on the board.  Identify those who have served for more than 10 years.


3. **Check for Independence Affirmation:** Once you've identified the vintage members, carefully read the text associated with each. Look for statements confirming they've affirmed their independence. Pay close attention to sections discussing corporate governance, director responsibilities, and independent director declarations.  There may be a separate section or an annexure that summarizes declarations from independent directors.


4. **Quote the Source and Page Number:** Once you locate the source confirming independence declarations for the vintage members, write down the exact text and the page number.

Madhur Deora: His appointment date is 20-05-2022. As this date is within the last 5 years, he is considered not permanent.

Ravi Chandra Adusumalli: His appointment date is 16-02-2012. This date is more than 5 years prior to March 31st, 2024, therefore, he is classified as permanent.


Ashit Ranjit Lilani: His appointment date is 05-07-2021. Since this is within the last 5 years before March 31st, 2024, he is considered not permanent.


Srinivasaraghavan Gopalasamudram Sundararajan: His appointment date is 29-08-2022.  His appointment date falls within the last 5 years, hence, he is not permanent.


Rajeev Krishnamuralilal Agarwal: His appointment date is 17-06-2024. This date is within the last 5 years prior to March 31st, 2024; therefore, he is not permanent.

My apologies for the unclear initial request.  I'm looking for information from the provided One 97 Communications Ltd corporate governance report (pages 2-15 of the OCR output).  I need a list of the Board of Directors and the following information for each:

* **Name:** The full name of the board member.
* **Appointment Date:** The date the board member was initially appointed to the board.
* **Reappointment Date (if applicable):** The date of any reappointments within the past 5 years (from March 31st, 2024, going back).  If there has been no reappointment within the last five years, indicate ""N/A"".
* **Status:** Based on the appointment and reappointment dates:
    * **Recent Appointment:** If appointed within the last 5 years.
    * **Recent Reappointment:** If reappointed within the last 5 years.
    * **Permanent:** If neither of the above conditions is met.

The goal is to categorize each board member based on the recency of their appointment or reappointment to the board.  The provided text includes tables with this information, but it's not organized in a single, readily extractable list.
This is a good summary of the board member information from the provided document.  The categorization of ""Permanent,"" ""Recent Reappointment,"" and ""Recent Appointment"" is helpful and reflects the information available.  Here are a few minor suggestions for improvement:


* **Clarify ""Permanent"":**  While ""Permanent"" is understandable, it might be clearer to say something like ""Initial Appointment Date Before [Date]"" or ""Long-Term Director"" to avoid implying indefinite tenure.  It's important to remember that even long-serving directors have terms and can be removed or choose not to stand for re-election.  A date range would improve precision.

* **Madhur Deora's Status:** The lack of an initial appointment date is crucial.  ""Recent Reappointment"" is accurate but doesn't fully capture the uncertainty around the initial appointment.  Consider adding a note specifying the absence of that information, e.g., ""Recent Reappointment; Initial appointment date not available in this document.""

* **Consistency in Date Format:**  The dates are presented inconsistently (DD-MM-YYYY vs MM-DD-YYYY).  A consistent format (DD-MM-YYYY is preferable for international consistency) would improve readability.


Here's a revised presentation incorporating these suggestions:

You are looking at the policies extracted from the company website. Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.,"Yes, One97 Communications Limited (Paytm) has a policy addressing conflicts of interest.  The policy, titled ""Conflicts of Interest Policy, Version 2.0,"" which was extracted from the company website, outlines the minimum expectations regarding business practices to avoid conflicts of interest.

The policy explicitly addresses several scenarios of potential conflict, including outside employment, financial investments, relationships with family, friends, and romantic partners, supplier and customer relationships, and gifts and entertainment.  It also mandates disclosures of any potential or existing conflicts of interest to a manager and HRBP.

While the policy doesn't explicitly use the term ""board cross linkages,""  the section on ""Outside Employment and preserving Business Interests"" (5.1)  implies that if a board member has external employment that could potentially impact their duties or create a conflict with Paytm's interests, then it should be disclosed and managed as per the policy.  The policy's scope extends to all employees, trainees, consultants, and associates, including (implicitly) members of the board.  The broad scope of this section suggests that it would encompass such cross linkages.  Therefore, while the wording isn't explicit, the principles of the policy would likely apply to potential conflicts of interest arising from board cross-linkages.

Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ,"Based on the Paytm Annual Report 2024 (page 96), the voting rights of promoters are *not* explicitly mentioned.  The report states that as of March 31, 2024, the company is a professionally managed company and does not have an identifiable promoter.  Therefore, disclosures related to promoter shareholding are not applicable.

There is no mention of pyramidal holding structures in the annual report that would disproportionately give more voting power to promoters.

Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ","Based on the Paytm Annual Report (March 31, 2024), the holding structure, while detailed, does not give the impression of being completely opaque.  The report clearly outlines the ownership interest held by various entities, including subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures.  However,  the complexity of the structure, particularly the involvement of entities in different jurisdictions and the presence of indirect ownership, does make it challenging to immediately determine the ultimate beneficiary.  The report explicitly addresses the shareholding percentages at various levels of the structure, on page 90 and further clarifies certain complex holdings on pages 247, 251, 252, 357-361,  but tracing complete ownership across all layers requires careful analysis.  Therefore, while not opaque in the sense of withholding crucial information, the intricacy of the structure may make determining the ultimate beneficiary a complex task.

The report details the holdings of One 97 Communications Limited and its subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures on pages 247-255.  This section lists each entity, its ownership percentage, and whether it's a subsidiary, associate, or joint venture.  

While the data is extensive, a simple assessment cannot definitively identify *complicated* cross-holdings.  To determine if such complications exist would require a thorough analysis of the financial relationships described within this section and potentially other sections of the annual report, along with potentially outside knowledge about the entities themselves.

* **Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (POSH):** This policy directly addresses the safety and welfare of female employees by outlining procedures for preventing and addressing sexual harassment.

* **Equal Employment Opportunity Policy for Persons with Disabilities:** This policy promotes a safe and inclusive work environment by ensuring equal opportunities for employees with disabilities and providing appropriate accommodations.

* **Code of Conduct:** While not solely focused on health and safety, this overarching policy establishes general standards of conduct and respect for each other, which indirectly contributes to a safer and more supportive work environment.  This contributes to employee welfare.

Please note that the presence of other policies related to health and safety is possible but not explicitly mentioned or detailed in the provided text.  The information above is based solely on the documents provided from the company's website.

Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.","The One97 Communications Limited's **Employee Learning & Development Policy (Version 1.0)** addresses the prevention of occupation-related injuries, accidents, and illnesses.  While it doesn't explicitly state ""prevention of occupation-related injuries,"" the policy focuses on proactive risk mitigation through training and awareness programs.


Specifically, section 5 of the policy, *Risk Mitigation*, states that integrating risk mitigation into learning initiatives equips employees with the tools and knowledge to navigate challenges effectively.  This includes training on:


*   **Compliance**:  Ensuring compliance with relevant laws and standards, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidents and injuries due to non-compliance.
*   **Cybersecurity Awareness**:  Mitigating risks associated with data breaches and cyber threats, which could indirectly cause workplace accidents or injuries in the case of system failures.
*   **Ethical Conduct**:  Promoting safe work practices and reducing risky behaviors.
*   **Risk Management**: Empowering employees to identify and mitigate risks, including those related to workplace safety.
*   **Product Knowledge**:  Reducing errors by ensuring employees have thorough training on products and procedures.


The policy highlights the importance of risk mitigation as a key component of employee learning and development, thereby implicitly promoting workplace safety and the prevention of injuries, accidents, and illnesses.  This is an indirect approach to mitigating workplace hazards but shows a dedication to proactive risk management, which is a vital aspect of preventing occupation-related incidents.

Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.","Yes, the company provides training on health and safety, and sexual harassment.

The **Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (POSH)**, states that the company is committed to providing a work environment that is transparent in its conduct, being fair and non-discriminatory.  This policy  covers the key aspects of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.  (Page 33)

The **Equal Employment Opportunity Policy for Persons with Disabilities** mentions that the company is committed to providing a work environment that is inclusive and non-discriminatory, and promotes equal opportunities for personnel irrespective of gender.  It also mentions that the company will provide adequate facilities and amenities to persons with disabilities to enable them to effectively discharge their duties. (Page 43)

Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.","Based on the provided document extracts from Paytm's website, the answer is **yes**, some policies related to health, safety and welfare cover the company's suppliers and vendors.  However, there isn't a single policy explicitly stating this for *all* health, safety and welfare aspects.  The coverage is implied and spread across multiple policies:


* **Code of Conduct:** While this document doesn't directly mention supplier/vendor health and safety, section 1, ""Our Ways of Working,"" sets out a commitment to high standards of professional conduct that extends to business partners and stakeholders. This implies a certain level of expectation for ethical behavior which would likely incorporate some basic health and safety standards.  Also section 2.2, ""What is my Responsibility,"" explicitly covers the expectation of ethical conduct for suppliers and vendors.

* **Protection & Use of Company Property:** This policy (section 7) indirectly addresses supplier responsibility in relation to their handling of company property and data.  A violation by a supplier could lead to penalties and legal action.

* **Compliance with Laws, Rules & Regulations:**  This section (section 8) explicitly requires compliance from suppliers with legal requirements.  This compliance may cover aspects of health, safety, and welfare depending on applicable law.

It's important to note that while the policies aim to create a responsible business environment, the specific extent of their application regarding supplier health, safety, and welfare will be influenced by individual contracts and applicable laws.  There isn't a dedicated policy explicitly outlining health and safety standards for all suppliers and vendors in one place.

Finally sumarize your verdict whether the company has policies for supplier/vendor selection as well as supplier/vendor management. You are looking at the policies extracted from the company website. Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.","Based on the provided document extracts from Paytm's website, here's the information regarding supplier/vendor selection and management:

**Supplier/Vendor Selection:**

The document doesn't contain a specific policy solely dedicated to supplier/vendor selection. However, some aspects are mentioned within other policies.  Specifically, the **Information Security Policy** touches upon supplier selection in section 23, ""Supplier Relationships"":

> *All the suppliers (outsourcing vendors, agents, third parties and other contract employees) who have access to internal information / information assets to maintain confidentiality and adopt security procedures. Supplier’s access to internal information / information assets shall be restricted. Refer (Supplier Relationship Management Policy) for detailed policy.*

This excerpt shows that security is a key criterion during the selection process, implying a vetting procedure occurs to ensure suppliers meet Paytm's security standards before granting access to sensitive information.  There is no explicit detail of what other standards are applied beyond this security focus.

**Supplier/Vendor Management:**

The **Information Security Policy** (Section 23, ""Supplier Relationships"") also touches on vendor management:

> *All the suppliers (outsourcing vendors, agents, third parties and other contract employees) who have access to internal information / information assets to maintain confidentiality and adopt security procedures. Supplier’s access to internal information / information assets shall be restricted. Refer (Supplier Relationship Management Policy) for detailed policy.*

Again,  the focus here is on managing security risks associated with the suppliers' access to sensitive information.  The policy mandates restricting access and adopting security procedures.  The document also directs the reader to a separate policy, ""Supplier Relationship Management Policy"", for more comprehensive details on vendor management,  but the contents of that separate policy are not provided.

**Verdict:**

Paytm has explicit policies concerning Information Security, which includes some aspects of supplier selection and management, primarily focusing on security. However,  a dedicated and comprehensive policy specifically detailing the full criteria for supplier/vendor selection and a full management framework is not present in these extracts.  The existence of a separate ""Supplier Relationship Management Policy"" is mentioned, but its content is unavailable in these document extracts. Therefore, while there is evidence of security-focused processes, a complete picture of Paytm's supplier selection and management policies is not available from the provided documents alone.

**Lenders:**

* **Annexure B to Independent Auditor's Report (page 189):**  The report details several instances where loans had fallen due, including those to Little Internet Private Limited, Arthimpact Finserve Private Limited, Urja Money Private Limited, Robust Infocom Private Limited, and Rooter Sports Technologies Private Limited.  While some repayments were regular, others had overdue amounts.  The report specifies the overdue principal and interest amounts for each loan.


**Creditors and Suppliers:**

* **Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements (page 240):** The notes discuss trade receivables, which are amounts due from customers.  A breakdown of these receivables by the age of the debt (showing overdue amounts) is provided (page 240-241). The notes detail the amount overdue, and also refer to note 25 for information on related parties which could indicate other potentially overdue payments.
* **Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 373):**  Similar to the Standalone statements,  this section analyzes trade receivables and outlines overdue amounts. Again, the details of related party transactions (which might include overdue amounts to suppliers or other creditors) are specified in Note 26.
* **Annexure II (page 471 & 472):**  Details of contracts/ arrangements with related parties are listed. This section may include details of overdue payments based on the specific contractual obligations and payment terms.  However, specific mention of overdue payments are not explicitly categorized in this section.


**Important Note:** The annual report explains that the company has generally been regular in depositing undisputed statutory dues.  However, the existence of any overdue amounts, as detailed in the sections above, suggests there were some delays in payment to certain parties.

**Payments to Creditors and Suppliers:**

On page 87, note 3(ii)(a) of the Standalone Financial Statements states that undisputed statutory dues (including provident fund, etc.) had been generally deposited with the appropriate authorities though there were some slight delays in a few cases.   The report indicates that the company was generally regular in depositing these dues.  


**Important Note:** The audit report does not constitute a guarantee that all payments have been made on time.  It expresses an opinion based on the audit evidence obtained.

You are looking at the annual report as of 31st March 2024. Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ","Based on the provided Paytm Annual Report (2024), here's a summary regarding the auditor's report, qualified opinions, emphasis of matters, and any information related to auditor resignations:

**Auditor's Report and Opinions:**

The independent auditor's report (pages 171-178 for standalone and 285-295 for consolidated financial statements) expresses an *unmodified opinion* on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements of Paytm for the year ended March 31, 2024.  This means the auditors found the financial statements to be fairly presented and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in India.


**Emphasis of Matter:**

* **Standalone Financial Statements:** The auditors highlight two *key audit matters*  (page 172):

    1. **Impairment of investment in Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL):** Due to RBI restrictions on PPBL's operations, an impairment loss was recognized.  The auditors describe their procedures to address this (verification of RBI press release, discussions with management, testing of arithmetical accuracy, and assessment of relevant disclosures).

    2. **Recoverable value of investment in subsidiaries and other associates:**  The determination of recoverable value involved significant judgements and estimates.  The auditors again outline their steps to assess this (evaluation of the company's impairment model, checking data against budgets, assessing sensitivity analysis, and ensuring relevant disclosures).

* **Consolidated Financial Statements:** The auditors state one *emphasis of matter* (page 286):

    1. **Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL):**  Similar to the standalone report, the impact of RBI restrictions on PPBL is highlighted.  The auditors' procedures to assess this are detailed (review of RBI press release and FAQs, discussion with management, testing of arithmetical accuracy, and review of disclosures).


**Management Comments on Key Audit Matters:**

Management's discussion and analysis sections (pages 8-21) address the RBI directive and subsequent actions taken by Paytm, including the transition of PPBL services to other partners.  They discuss how these measures aimed to de-risk the business model and open up long-term monetization opportunities.


**Auditor Resignation:**

There is no mention in the report of any auditor resigning due to a difference of opinion or any suspicious reason.  While the report notes a change of statutory auditors for Paytm Payments Services Limited (PPSL) (page 95), this was due to a resignation, and not linked to any disputes or concerns.


**Important Note:** This information is solely based on the provided Paytm Annual Report (2024).  A complete and thorough analysis would require reviewing the full document.

**Auditor's Report (Page 179-185):**

* **Qualified Opinion:** The independent auditor, Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants LLP, did *not* issue a qualified opinion on Paytm's standalone financial statements.  Their opinion was unmodified. (Page 179)

* **Emphasis of Matter:** The auditors did highlight one key audit matter concerning the assessment of the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries and associates (Page 180).  The report details the procedures undertaken to address this matter.  Management's assessment of the carrying value was considered reasonable by the auditors.

* **Auditor Resignation:** There is no mention of an auditor resigning due to a difference of opinion or any suspicious reason in the auditor's report.  The report only mentions the planned rotation of statutory auditors, with M/s. S.R. Batliboi & Associates LLP succeeding M/s. Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants LLP (Page 237).


**Management's Response (Page 204-209):**

The ""Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged With Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements"" section (Page 181) details management's responsibilities regarding the preparation of the financial statements. This section includes a discussion of their assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern and the use of accounting estimates. However, there is no direct response to the auditor's key audit matter emphasis.  It's implied that the management is confident that their approach and justifications are sound given the auditor's unmodified opinion.


**In summary:**  The auditors did not raise any major concerns or qualified opinions.  The key audit matter was addressed and the auditor's opinion remained unmodified. There was no mention of auditor resignation for suspicious reasons in the report provided.

The information is extracted from pages 78-81 and 169-175.

**Qualified Opinion:**

The independent auditor's report (page 78) expresses an *unmodified* opinion on the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  This means no qualified opinion was issued.

**Emphasis of Matter:**

Yes, there are *emphasis of matter* paragraphs in both the standalone and consolidated auditor's reports.

* **Standalone Report (page 78):**  The auditors highlight two key matters:
    1. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business operations (Note 2.1).  The auditors acknowledge the uncertainty of its future impact.
    2. Non-realization of foreign currency receivables and non-settlement of foreign currency payables (Note 35). The auditors note the management's actions to address these issues but state that their opinion is not modified.

* **Consolidated Report (page 169):** The auditors highlight three key matters:
    1.  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (Note 2.1). Similar to the standalone report, they acknowledge the uncertainty of future impact.
    2. Non-realization of foreign currency receivables and non-settlement of foreign currency payables (Note 39).  Again, they note management's actions and state that their opinion is not modified.
    3.  A subsidiary's classification as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) (Note 42). The auditors note that the subsidiary's management does not intend to operate as an NBFC and has applied for a dispensation from RBI.  The auditors' opinion is not modified.


**Management's Comments:**

The management's discussion and analysis section provides context to the emphasis of matter paragraphs raised by the auditors.  In the case of the COVID-19 impact, management discusses the steps taken to manage the pandemic's effects and the progress towards profitability. Regarding foreign currency transactions, management explains the actions they have undertaken and clarifies the related details. For the NBFC classification, management states that the subsidiary does not intend to operate as an NBFC and has made the necessary application for dispensation.

**Auditor Resignation:**

There is no mention in the auditor's report that the auditors resigned due to a difference of opinion or for any suspicious reason.  The reports indicate a continued working relationship and the issuance of unmodified opinions.

**Important Note:**  This analysis is based solely on the provided Paytm Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2022.  Always consult the full report and any subsequent filings for the most comprehensive and up-to-date information.

The report does contain some biographical information on board members and key management personnel, but it is spread across multiple pages and sections, and not consistently formatted.  This makes compiling the exact data points you need difficult using only OCR.

To get the information you need, I recommend:

1. **Directly Accessing the Paytm Website:** Go to the official Paytm investor relations website.  Their annual reports often contain more detailed information than what's available via OCR.  Look for the FY24 annual report's section on corporate governance, the board of directors, or key management personnel.  These sections will likely contain the biographical details you're requesting.

2. **Reviewing the Full PDF:** If you already downloaded the Paytm annual report PDF, open it directly.  The PDF will be more reliable for finding the specific details than relying on OCR's text extraction.

I cannot directly access and process online documents or external websites (including Paytm's website), so I am unable to provide you with the information from those sources.

**Note:** The annual report doesn't specify the number of years of experience for most board members in their respective areas of expertise.  Only broad areas of expertise are mentioned, and not a precise quantification of experience.  


**Collective Board Expertise (Over 10 Years):**

To determine collective expertise exceeding 10 years, we need precise years of experience for each director in each area. This information is not readily available in the provided document.  The report only provides broad areas of expertise.  Therefore, it is impossible to definitively answer which areas the board collectively possesses expertise for more than 10 years based solely on the information provided.
That's a much clearer phrasing of the request.  To make it even better, let's add some context about the source material:

""Based on the Paytm Annual Report (FY24), can you please provide information on the area(s) of expertise for each board member and their corresponding number of years of experience?  Specifically, are there any areas where the *combined* expertise of the board members exceeds 10 years?""


This revised question:

* Clearly specifies the source document (Paytm's FY24 Annual Report).
* Uses the word ""combined"" to clarify that you're looking for the total number of years of expertise across *all* board members in a given area, not just individual expertise exceeding 10 years.
* Remains concise and professional.

My apologies; I misread the date on the notice. The provided document shows the AGM date as September 30, 2024, not August 6th.  The financial year end is March 31, 2024.

```This is a good summary of the related party transactions disclosed in the annual report.  However,  to make it more useful and insightful, consider these improvements:

**1.  Expand on the nature of the transactions:** The current summary only lists the amounts.  Adding a brief description of *what* these transactions represent would significantly improve clarity and context. For example:

* **Investments:**  Instead of just the amounts, specify if these are equity investments, loans, or other forms of investment.  The report may indicate the percentage of ownership held.
* **Remuneration:**  This should be clarified as salaries, bonuses, stock options, or other forms of compensation. Specifying if these are fixed or variable would also be helpful.
* **Loans:** Specify the interest rate and terms (maturity date, repayment schedule) of these loans.  Were they secured or unsecured?
* **Rent:**  Specify the property or properties involved.
* **Balance Outstanding:** This needs significantly more detail.  What is the nature of the outstanding balance?  Is it accrued interest, outstanding invoices, loans receivable?

**2.  Clearly delineate between subsidiaries, KMPs, and other related parties:** The report mixes amounts due from subsidiaries, KMPs, and the managing director.  Separate sections for these categories are crucial for better understanding.

**3.  Add a total amount:** Calculating the total value of all related party transactions would give a quick overview of their materiality to the company's overall financials.

**4. Compliance with Regulations:** Briefly mention whether the disclosures are in accordance with applicable accounting standards and regulations (like Ind AS 24).  The report likely references this compliance.


**Example of Improved Summary:**

**Related Party Transactions for the Year Ended March 31, 2024**

This summary details related party transactions as disclosed in the company's annual report. Note that it may not be exhaustive and may not represent the most up-to-date information.

**I. Transactions with Subsidiaries:**

These figures represent equity investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries (unless otherwise stated).  The company should disclose percentage ownership in each.

* **Luxury Products Trendsetter Private Limited:** ₹0.01 equity investment.
* **PC Jeweller Global DMCC:** ₹133.86 equity investment.
* **PC Universal Private Limited:** ₹0.05 equity investment (ceased to be a subsidiary during the year).
* **PCJ Gems & Jewellery Limited:** ₹0.05 equity investment.
* **Transforming Retail Private Limited:** ₹0.01 equity investment (ceased to be a subsidiary in a prior year).


**II. Transactions with Key Management Personnel (KMP) and Directors:**

* **Remuneration:** This section should detail salary, bonuses, and other compensation for each individual, specifying whether these figures include fixed and variable components.
    * Mr. Balram Garg (Managing Director):  [Insert amount] Total Compensation. (Break down into salary, bonus, etc.)
    * Mr. Sanjeev Bhatia (CFO): [Insert amount] Total Compensation. (Break down into salary, bonus, etc.)
    * Mr. Vijay Panwar (Company Secretary): [Insert amount] Total Compensation. (Break down into salary, bonus, etc.)
    * Mr. Ramesh Kumar Sharma (Executive Director): [Insert amount] Total Compensation. (Break down into salary, bonus, etc.)


**III. Other Related Party Transactions:**

* **Rent paid to Mr. Balram Garg:** ₹0.01 for [Specify Property].
* **Outstanding Balances:**  A detailed explanation of the nature of each outstanding balance is needed.  (e.g., ""Accrued interest on loans to Mr. Balram Garg: ₹X"")


**IV. Total Related Party Transactions:**  ₹ [Insert Total Amount]


**V. Regulatory Compliance:**  Disclosures appear to be in accordance with Ind AS 24, but this should be verified against the full report.


By providing this level of detail, the summary becomes a much more valuable tool for analyzing the company's financial statements and governance practices. Remember to replace bracketed information with actual figures from the report.

1. **Identify the Company:**  You must provide the company's name.  The document only refers to ""PC Jeweller Limited.""

2. **Use Official Sources:** The most reliable place to find this information is the company's official website in their investor relations section.  Look for annual reports or quarterly filings.

3. **Check Stock Exchanges:** If the company is publicly traded, its financial statements will be available on the websites of the stock exchanges where it's listed (e.g., the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) or the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE)).

4. **Use Financial Data Providers:** Companies like Bloomberg, Refinitiv, or others specializing in financial data will have this information.  You'll likely need a subscription.

However, some information related to supplier engagement can be inferred from different policies:


**Indirect References to Supplier Relations:**

* **Business Responsibility Policy:** This policy mentions the Company's commitment to ethical conduct and fair dealing with stakeholders which implicitly includes suppliers. The policy emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and responsible resource management which could impact supplier selection criteria. However, no explicit supplier selection or management details are given.  (Source: PC Jeweller Limited's Business Responsibility Policy)


**Verdict:**

While PC Jeweller Limited's Business Responsibility Policy touches upon ethical business practices that would indirectly impact supplier relationships, there is no dedicated policy detailing specific standards and procedures for supplier/vendor selection and management within the provided document set.  Therefore, the evidence suggests that while the company acknowledges the importance of ethical conduct in its dealings, it does not explicitly outline its supplier/vendor selection or management practices in any of the included policies.

* **Page 12:** State Bank of India (SBI) moved the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Delhi (DRT), for recovery of dues.  The company responded with appeals which are sub-judice.  The situation is further complicated by actions from other banks including the Union Bank of India.

* **Page 104:** A table details the period and amount of default in loan repayments at year-end. Multiple lenders are listed with varying degrees of overdue amounts ranging from 1 to 1095 days.  The company disputes several of these amounts.


**Creditors and Suppliers:**

* **Page 105:** There is mention of outstanding dues to creditors,  specifically trade payables, categorized by micro enterprises and small enterprises versus other creditors.  Amounts are also indicated for disputed debts.

* **Page 130:**  Principal amounts and interest due remain unpaid to suppliers.  The company makes certain justifications relating to the MSMED Act 2006.

* **Page 178:**  Details of delayed payments are further clarified for various types of creditors and the justifications the company provided are detailed.

**Qualified Opinion:**

The auditors issued a qualified opinion because of three material uncertainties related to:

1.  **Discounts to export customers (Note 51):** The company provided significant discounts to export customers in the financial year 2019, and the auditors were unable to fully verify the accounting treatment of the remaining discounts due to missing approvals and supporting documents.  (page 75)

2.  **Provision for expected credit loss on overdue overseas receivables (Note 52):**  Significant overdue receivables existed, and the auditors couldn't fully verify the adequacy of the provision for impairment due to uncertainties about recovery. (page 75)

3.  **Inventory valuation (Note 52):** The company's inventory was held under court custody, preventing physical verification by the auditors and the management. The auditors relied on management's valuation, resulting in an inability to fully examine the inventory value. (page 76)


**Management's Comments on Qualified Opinion:**

The management provides detailed explanations for each of the three issues in the notes to the standalone financial statements (pages 140-142, 140-142, and 140-142). Management addresses each point and justifies the accounting treatments they have followed.

**Emphasis of Matter:**

The auditors highlight two specific matters requiring attention (page 76):

1.  **Delay in receipt of foreign currency proceeds (Note 52):** The company encountered delays in receiving export payments in foreign currency. The auditors note that the management has applied for condonation of these delays, but as the potential penalties were unascertainable, no adjustments were made.
2.  **Deferred Tax Assets (Note 8):** Because of recurring losses, the company did not recognize deferred tax assets.


**Management's Comments on Emphasis of Matter:**

The management addresses these items in the notes to the standalone financial statements (pages 140-142, and 140-142), providing explanations for the delay in foreign currency receipts and the absence of deferred tax assets.


**Auditor Resignation:**

The annual report does mention that M/s Arun K. Agarwal & Associates resigned as statutory auditors on 14 August 2023 (page 15) but does *not* state the reason for resignation.  It simply states that the resignation was based on ""economic viability"", suggesting financial reasons rather than differences of opinion or suspicious reasons.

**Qualified Opinion:** Yes, the independent auditor, M/s Arun K. Agarwal & Associates, issued a qualified opinion.  (Page 67, Standalone Financial Statements)

The basis for the qualified opinion centers around three key issues:

1. **Discounts to Export Customers (Page 67):**  The company gave significant discounts (₹513.65 crore) to export customers in FY19. While approvals for some of these discounts were obtained subsequently, approvals for the remaining ₹183.16 crore were pending.  The auditors couldn't assess the impact of these unapproved discounts on the standalone financial statements.

2. **Provision for Expected Credit Loss/Impairment (Page 67):**  Significant overdue overseas trade receivables existed. Although the company made provisions, the auditors couldn't determine if this was adequate, given the lack of realization and pending legal action related to debt recovery.

3. **Inventory Valuation (Page 67-68):**  Due to legal action involving the seizure of inventory, a physical verification couldn't be performed by the company at various locations by the audit deadline.  The auditors therefore could not validate the inventory value.

**Management's Response to Qualified Opinion:** The management provides detailed explanations for each point under the section  ""Management Discussion & Analysis""  (pages 62-66) clarifying their position and actions taken to address the auditor’s concerns.  

**Emphasis of Matter:** Yes, there are two items emphasized by the auditor (page 68).

1. **Delays in Receipt of Foreign Currency Proceeds (Page 68):**  Significant delays in receiving payments for overseas exports occurred, potentially breaching the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.  Management explained they applied for condonation of the delay.

2. **Impairment Assessment of Subsidiaries (Page 68):**  The management performed an impairment assessment of its subsidiaries using the Discounted Cash Flow model.  While they recognized an additional provision, it was a complex calculation with inherent estimation uncertainty.

**Auditor Resignation:** The annual report does *not* indicate that the auditor resigned due to a difference of opinion or any suspicious reason.  While there is a mention of M/s Arun K. Agarwal & Associates resigning as Statutory Auditors on page 207, no reason was given in this context.  However, the report does state that the Board approved the appointment of a new auditor (AHPN) following their resignation.

**Important Note:**  Always refer to the full text of the auditor's report and the management discussion and analysis for a comprehensive understanding. This analysis provides a summary for ease of comprehension.

This information is found on pages 53-55 of the annual report.

**Qualified Opinion:**

The auditor's report states that their opinion is qualified due to:

1.  **Discounts to export customers:**  The company provided significant discounts to export customers in a prior year, which were adjusted against revenues for that year.  The auditors were unable to verify the impact, if any, because of the lack of requisite approvals and supporting documentation.  (Page 55)


2.  **Delays in receiving foreign currency proceeds:** Delays were incurred in receiving payments denominated in foreign currency from overseas customers. The auditors expressed uncertainty regarding the possible material impact of any penalties that may be levied for these delays. (Page 55)


3. **Impairment Assessment:** The management's complex impairment assessment of investments and receivables  using the 'Discounted Cash Flow Valuation Model' caused the auditor to express a qualified opinion (page 55).

**Emphasis of Matter:**

The auditor's report also emphasizes the following matters:

1.  Further details on the discounts provided to export customers in 2019. (Page 55)
2.  The uncertainties and management's assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial statements. (Page 55)

**Management Comment:**

The annual report includes management's response to the auditor's qualified opinion and emphasis of matter on pages 117-121.  Management provides explanations for both issues, primarily attributing them to unforeseen circumstances (especially the pandemic and resulting economic difficulties), stating that the issues have been partially or are being resolved and that there will likely be no material impact on the financial results.

","Yes, PC Jeweller Limited has a Dividend Distribution Policy, as evidenced by the document extracted from their website.  The policy does not specify a fixed dividend payout ratio. Instead, it outlines the circumstances under which shareholders may or may not expect a dividend and the factors considered when declaring one.

**Relevant Policy Name:** Dividend Distribution Policy

**Guidance on Dividend Payout:**

The policy states that the Board of Directors will assess the company's financial requirements, growth opportunities, and other relevant factors before deciding on a dividend payout.  Shareholders may *not* expect a dividend under the following circumstances:

*   Future expansion plans requiring higher capital allocation
*   Requirement of higher working capital
*   Acquisitions, amalgamations, mergers, joint ventures, new product launches requiring significant capital outflow
*   Lenders restricting dividend payments
*   Losses or inadequate profits


The decision considers several factors, including:

*   Liquidity position and future cash flow needs
*   Profits earned during the year
*   Working capital requirements
*   Capital expenditure
*   Business expansion and growth
*   Contingent liabilities
*   Investments in subsidiaries and associates
*   Cost of borrowing
*   Loan agreement stipulations/covenants
*   Past dividend payout ratio/trends
*   Comparable companies' dividend payout ratios
*   Other relevant factors

The policy emphasizes that the decision aims to balance rewarding shareholders through dividends with maintaining a healthy capital adequacy ratio to support future growth.  Therefore, there's no set dividend payout ratio.

Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ,"Here's the information you requested from PC Jeweller Limited's Annual Report for the year ended 31st March 2024:


**CEO Compensation:**

The annual report does not explicitly state the CEO's compensation separately.  Instead, it provides the remuneration for the Managing Director, which is likely the same individual.  The Managing Director's remuneration for the year ended March 31, 2024 was **₹14.35 crore**. (Page 11, Annual Report 2023-24)

**Net Profit:**

The standalone net loss (net profit is negative) for the company for the year ended March 31, 2024 was **₹(649.27) crore**. (Page 10, Annual Report 2023-24)

**Ratio Calculation (R2):**

Given the net *loss* rather than profit, a direct ratio calculation isn't meaningful.  To illustrate the relative proportion of the Managing Director's remuneration compared to the loss, we can calculate the ratio as follows:


R2 = |Managing Director Compensation| / |Net Loss| =  14.35 crore / 649.27 crore = 0.022

This indicates that the Managing Director's remuneration represents approximately 2.2% of the absolute value of the net loss.  Again, this is not a standard profitability ratio due to the negative net profit.

Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ","The provided annual report for PC Jeweller Limited as of 31st March 2024 does not provide a breakdown of the CEO's compensation into long-term and short-term components.  Therefore, the ratio R1 cannot be calculated.  The relevant information regarding CEO compensation is on page 11.
You're right, the provided annual report doesn't explicitly break down the CEO's compensation into a precise ratio of long-term incentives versus short-term bonuses (R1).  Therefore, calculating R1 directly isn't possible from this document.

However, we can explore the suggested alternative metrics to gain insight into the CEO's compensation structure:


**1. Ratio of Stock-Based Compensation to Total Compensation:**

The report does not provide information on stock-based compensation for the CEO.  This metric therefore cannot be calculated.


**2. Proportion of Performance-Based Bonuses versus Fixed Salaries:**

The report doesn't explicitly state the CEO's compensation as a separate line item with a breakdown of fixed salary and performance-based bonuses.  We cannot calculate this ratio.


**3. Duration of Vesting Periods for Equity Awards:**

The report mentions the CEO received no bonus or stock options.  Therefore, there are no equity awards with vesting periods to analyze.


**Overall Conclusion:**

The provided 2024 annual report lacks the detailed breakdown of the CEO's compensation needed to calculate the requested ratio (R1) or to effectively utilize the suggested alternative metrics.  More information directly from the company would be needed to answer this question comprehensively.

**1. Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management:** This policy clearly outlines the expectation of honesty, integrity, responsibility, and accountability from directors and senior management.  It explicitly states that they ""shall not engage in any business, activity or relationship, which may be in conflict with the interest of the Company"" and prohibits exploiting opportunities for personal gain unless disclosed to and approved by the Board. It also addresses confidentiality and prohibits insider trading.  The policy further specifies disciplinary action for non-compliance with the code.

**2. Business Responsibility Policy:** This policy reiterates the company's commitment to ethical conduct, stating that it maintains ""highest standards of ethics while conducting business activities"" and aims to ensure ethical behavior at all levels.  It specifically addresses transparency and accountability, emphasizing that disclosures made in business documents must be accurate and correct. The policy also includes sections on conflict of interest and mentions the existence of other related policies that further promote ethics and good governance.

**Quote:**  ""The Company maintains highest standards of ethics while conducting the business activities.

**3. Policy for Determination of Materiality of Events or Information:** While not explicitly an ethics policy, this document contributes to ethical practices by outlining transparent and timely disclosure procedures.  Accurate and complete information is crucial for ethical market behavior.

In summary, PC Jeweller Limited's policies from its website demonstrate a clear commitment to ethical conduct, including measures to prevent bribery and corruption, and establish clear expectations for ethical behavior from its employees, directors, and third parties. The policies also define procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest and include provisions for disciplinary action in cases of ethical breaches.

This is covered in their ""Tata Code of Conduct 2015,"" specifically Section C, ""Our Core Principles,"" and Section D, ""Our Employees,""  as well as other sections within the document.  This information was obtained from policies extracted from the company website.

The Code of Conduct does not explicitly use the term ""board cross-linkages."" However, it addresses potential conflicts of interest arising from various relationships, including those with:


* **Employees:** The policy details how conflicts might arise from personal associations affecting work,  and mandates full disclosure of any potential or actual conflicts to the competent authority. (Section D. Our Employees, point 24)

* **Value-chain partners:**  The policy outlines expectations for fair and transparent dealings with suppliers, distributors, and other business associates. It stresses the avoidance of actions that create conflicts of interest or the appearance of impropriety. (Section G. Our Value-Chain Partners)


* **Financial stakeholders:** The document highlights the importance of fair and accurate reporting to financial stakeholders, implying a need to avoid conflicts of interest that could compromise this transparency. (Section H. Our Financial Stakeholders)


* **Government:** The policy emphasizes acting in accordance with the law and maintaining transparency in interactions with government agencies, again suggesting a need to avoid conflicts of interest in such dealings. (Section I. Governments)


While the ""Tata Code of Conduct 2015"" doesn't explicitly address ""board cross-linkages"" as a defined term, the principles within the document strongly suggest a framework for managing any potential conflicts of interest that could arise from board member relationships with other stakeholders.  The policy emphasizes transparency, fair dealing, and compliance with the law, all of which would be essential components of mitigating the risks associated with board interlocks or cross-linkages.

**Page 7:**  A section details ""Our Businesses and Subsidiaries"" with a chart showing the various companies and subsidiaries under Tata Motors Limited.

While there are many subsidiaries, the structure is not unusually complex in the sense that there are no circular or overly intricate ownership arrangements apparent.

**Page 132:**  The section on ""Cyber Security Governance"" mentions accountability for managing cybersecurity resides across various teams/levels, indicating inter-dependence across business units and perhaps a need for coordination.

**Page 257:** The section on ""Details of Non-Convertible Debentures"" notes redemption of debentures issued by various entities within the Group, suggesting that the entities share financial responsibility and perhaps inter-dependence.  

**Page 258:** The  ""Details of Material Subsidiaries"" section lists numerous subsidiaries and their statutory auditors, further underscoring the existence of the cross-entity structure within the larger Tata group.

**Pages 259-261:** There are several disclosures related to transactions and compliance, showing that the group's activities are closely interlinked and subject to regulations aimed at inter-company collaboration and transparency.

In conclusion, while the report shows a complex organizational structure with multiple subsidiaries and inter-related entities, the descriptions and financial reporting don't point to unusually complicated cross-entity ownership or control relationships.

The exact policy names aren't explicitly stated in a single, concise list, but several sections within the ""Tata Code of Conduct 2015"" and the ""Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy"" address various aspects of employee well-being.

Specifically, the following are mentioned (the source is Tata Motors' website):

* **Tata Code of Conduct 2015:** This document contains sections (D. Our Employees) that directly relate to  employee health, safety, and welfare, including sections on:  equal opportunity employment,  dignity and respect, human rights (specifically prohibiting child labor and forced labor), and bribery and corruption.

* **Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy:** While primarily focused on ethical conduct, this policy indirectly relates to employee well-being by outlining expectations for a safe and respectful workplace.  Compliance with this policy helps maintain an environment free from harassment and other detrimental issues impacting employee safety and well-being.


It's important to note that the documents refer to the existence of other policies (such as a Gifts and Hospitality Policy, a Media and Communication Policy, and a Whistleblower policy) which would further address worker well-being.  However, these policies themselves are not included within the provided text.

""We shall not compromise safety in the pursuit of commercial advantage. We shall strive to provide a safe, healthy and clean working environment for our employees and all those who work with us.""

This commitment to safety is further elaborated on in section D, **""Our Employees,""** point 4, which emphasizes the creation of a conducive work environment built on tolerance, understanding, and respect for individual privacy.  Harassment of any kind is explicitly prohibited.  The company also has clear and fair disciplinary procedures that include an employee's right to be heard.

However, the information is spread across multiple documents and isn't consolidated under a single ""Supplier Selection Policy"" or ""Vendor Management Policy"" heading.

**Supplier/Vendor Selection:**

The information regarding supplier selection is primarily found within the **Tata Code of Conduct 2015**, specifically section G, ""Our Value-Chain Partners"".  This section states:

* **G.1:**  ""We shall select our suppliers and service providers fairly and transparently.""
* **G.2:** ""We seek to work with suppliers and service providers who can demonstrate that they share similar values. We expect them to adopt ethical standards comparable to our own.""
* **G.3:** ""Our suppliers and service providers shall represent our company only with duly authorised written permission from our company. They are expected to abide by the Code in their interactions with, and on behalf of us, including respecting the confidentiality of information shared with them.""

The document also mentions the importance of due diligence in selecting third-party agents, consultants, and other intermediaries (page 8 of the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy). This due diligence process includes checks on financial information, compliance records, and risk profiles.


**Supplier/Vendor Management:**

The provided documents don't explicitly detail a dedicated ""Vendor Management Policy""  with specific controls and standards, aside from what is mentioned in the Code of Conduct.  However, the following points illustrate control mechanisms implied in the provided text:

* **Tata Code of Conduct 2015**, section G, mentions that Tata Motors expects suppliers to abide by the Code of Conduct. This suggests an implied mechanism for controlling vendors indirectly through compliance to this code.
* **Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy** (page 8): Tata Motors outlines standards and processes related to dealing with third-party agents, consultants, and intermediaries. This implicitly covers vendor interactions, focusing on preventing bribery and corruption.

**Verdict:**

Tata Motors' provided documentation demonstrates that the company has a policy and guidelines for *supplier/vendor selection*, clearly articulated in its Code of Conduct 2015.  However, a formal, comprehensive *supplier/vendor management policy*  with detailed control mechanisms and standards, beyond the implicit requirements in the Code of Conduct and anti-bribery policy, is not explicitly provided in this document set.  Therefore, while the company addresses supplier selection, its approach to vendor management is less clearly defined through formal policy documents.

* **Notes to the Financial Statements, Note 30 (Trade Payables), page 352:**  This section shows outstanding dues as of March 31, 2023, categorized by overdue periods.  The existence of overdue amounts doesn't automatically mean *delayed* repayment as the amounts may be under dispute or subject to payment terms.

**In summary,** while the notes to the financial statements show several outstanding obligations as of March 31, 2023, the auditor's report and accompanying notes do not explicitly state that any repayments were *delayed* as of that date.

The information is presented in a way that requires some interpretation:


**1.  Trade Payables:**

* **Page 229:** The notes to the financial statements (Note 25) show a breakdown of trade payables categorized by overdue periods.  While there are amounts listed as overdue, the report doesn't explicitly label them as *delayed* repayments.  The report mentions that overdue amounts exceeding six months total ₹2,111.78 crores as of March 31, 2022 (₹2,087.51 crores as of March 31, 2021).  However, it clarifies that a significant portion (₹513.90 crores) is from government organizations in India and considered recoverable.

**2. Other Financial Liabilities:**

* **Page 234:** (Note 27)  There is mention of outstanding amounts for small enterprises and creditors. The report mentions that as of March 31, 2022 there were ₹1,113.26 crores outstanding toward principal and interest provision on dues of micro and small enterprises.

**3.  Jaguar Land Rover:**

* **Page 234:** (Note 27)  The report notes that JLR had faced challenges, but the report does not use the word 'delayed' to describe the impact on payments.  There was a mention of reduced collections in the first quarter of FY22 impacting the trade receivables.


**4.  Auditor's Report (Standalone):**

* **Page 238:**  The auditor's report notes differences between the amounts reported in the quarterly statements and the book accounts for the quarters ended June 30, 2021, September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2021, specifically related to debtors and creditors. These were subsequently rectified by the end of March 31, 2022. While not explicitly labeled as *delayed* payments, these discrepancies suggest at least some issues with the timeliness of payments.


**Conclusion:**

The report indicates some instances of amounts outstanding beyond their due date,  particularly in trade payables for certain categories and JLR.  However, the report doesn't explicitly use the word ""delayed"" in a way that definitively states delayed payments to lenders, creditors, or suppliers as a general practice.  The discrepancies in the standalone auditor's report also indicate some irregularities in timely reporting and may infer that some payments may not have been made on time.  More detailed information would be needed to definitively confirm the existence of delayed payments.

We call these members as vintage members. Does it specify that vintage members affirm independence regularly? You are looking at the annual report as of 31st March 2024. Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ,"I cannot find relevant information regarding the appointment dates of board members or the identification of vintage members in the provided pages. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether vintage members affirm their independence regularly. 

However, based on my knowledge, companies typically disclose such information in their annual reports, including details about board member tenures and independence affirmations. You may want to refer to the specific section of the annual report that discusses the Board of Directors for the most accurate and detailed information.You're right, the original document doesn't explicitly state a definition for ""vintage members"" nor does it list all appointment dates in a single, easily accessible table.  The information is spread across several pages.  To answer your refined question, I need to piece together data from the provided document.  Here's what I've compiled:


**1. Appointment Dates for Board Members:**

This information is scattered and requires careful extraction. The provided text mentions some, but not all, appointment dates.  A complete list requires consulting the full document and would be a very time-consuming manual task.  The document's formatting prevents automated extraction of this information.


**2. Board Members on Board for More Than 10 Years (""Vintage"" Members):**

To identify those on the board for more than 10 years, we again need the precise appointment dates, which aren't fully listed in the provided text. This requires manual review of the entire document.


**3. Regular Affirmation of Independence for ""Vintage"" Members:**

Indian regulations (SEBI Listing Regulations, Companies Act, 2013, etc.) require *all* independent directors to regularly affirm their independence.  The frequency of this affirmation is typically annual and is not linked to the length of time they have served.  There's no special regulation or guideline for those serving more than 10 years that requires a *different* affirmation process.


**To Proceed Further:**

To get the complete and accurate information, please provide the full annual report document (not just the OCR'd text).  With the full document, I can provide a definitive answer to all three points.  Alternatively, if the precise appointment dates for each board member can be manually supplied, I can then calculate the tenure and confirm the independence affirmation requirement (which is standard for all independent directors).

The original question was ambiguous because it assumed a fact that isn't necessarily true in all organizations. Your revised question is much clearer.
That's a well-written and clear query.  Here are a few minor suggestions to make it even better:

**Option 1 (More Formal):**

Dear Tata Motors Investor Relations,

I am writing to request clarification regarding the composition of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) as detailed in the 79th Integrated Annual Report (as of 31 March 2024). My previous inquiry unfortunately did not specify the page number from which the information was obtained.

Could you please provide the page number(s) containing this information? I am specifically interested in confirming whether all members of the NRC are non-executive directors.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]


**Option 2 (Slightly Less Formal):**

Subject: Clarification - Page Number for NRC Composition (Annual Report)

Dear Tata Motors Investor Relations,

I'm writing to follow up on a previous inquiry about the composition of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC).  I couldn't find the page number in the 79th Annual Report (31 March 2024).

Could you please provide the page number(s) where this information is located?  I'd also like to confirm if all members are non-executive directors.

Thanks,

[Your Name]


**Key improvements:**

* **Specificity:**  Both options explicitly mention the report's title (""79th Integrated Annual Report"") and date (31 March 2024). This leaves no room for ambiguity.
* **Conciseness:** Option 2 is even more concise, which is beneficial for email communication.
* **Professional Tone:** Option 1 maintains a more formal tone, suitable if you have a more formal relationship with Tata Motors. Option 2 is friendlier, while still remaining professional.

Choose the option that best suits your communication style and relationship with Tata Motors.  Remember to replace ""[Your Name]"" with your actual name.

**CEO Compensation:**

The report does not explicitly state the CEO's compensation as a single figure.  Instead, it provides a breakdown of Mr. Girish Wagh's (Executive Director) remuneration for FY24 on page 141:

*   **Basic Salary:** ₹119.02 crore
*   **Benefits, Perquisites and Allowances:** ₹196.09 crore
*   **Commission, Bonus, and Performance Linked Incentive Remuneration:** ₹201.00 crore
*   **Retirement Benefits:** ₹32.14 crore
*   **Stock Options/Sweat Equity:** ₹148.35 crore

**Total Compensation:** ₹696.60 crore


**Net Profit:**

The consolidated net profit attributable to Tata Motors Limited shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, was ₹31,399 crore.  (Page 132)


**Ratio R2 Calculation:**

R2 = CEO Compensation / Net Profit 
R2 = ₹696.60 crore / ₹31,399 crore
R2 = 0.022 or 2.2%


**Important Note:**  This calculation uses the total remuneration for the Executive Director (Mr. Wagh), who also holds the position of CEO, as the CEO compensation figure. The annual report does not provide a separate compensation figure specifically designated as ""CEO Compensation"".
