You are looking at the policies extracted from the company website. Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.,"Yes, Shree Cement Limited has a policy addressing conflict of interest, specifically within its ""Ethics, Transparency and Accountability Policy and Code of Conduct"" obtained from the company website.

The policy explicitly addresses potential conflicts arising from:

* **Business dealings with stakeholders:** The policy outlines that employees should not engage in activities that create or appear to create a conflict between personal interests and the company's business interests.  This includes disclosing any perceived conflict (e.g., personal relationship with a vendor) and refraining from decision-making processes where such conflict exists.  It specifically prohibits insider trading and actions construed as anti-trust or anti-competitive.

* **Political and charitable contributions:**  The policy dictates that political donations are only permitted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with board approval, and charitable donations must be for legitimate causes and approved in accordance with delegated authority.

The policy, however, does *not* explicitly address board cross-linkages (i.e., directors or key personnel having relationships with other companies' boards or executives).  While it does address the broader issue of conflict of interest in business dealings, a separate section dedicated to board interlocks is not apparent in this document.

You are looking at the policies extracted from the company website. Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.,"Based on the provided document, ""Composition of Board Committees,"" there is no policy that explicitly prohibits an executive director from serving on the Audit Committee.  The list shows that Mr. Neeraj Akhoury, Managing Director, is a member of the Business Operations Committee and Share Transfer Committee but not the Audit Committee.  However, this doesn't explicitly state a prohibition.  Therefore, the answer is no based on the provided information.
Your approach is excellent and thorough.  Since you've already exhausted readily available public information from the company's website and haven't found a policy explicitly prohibiting executive directors from serving on the Audit Committee,  you've reached a point where further action is needed to definitively answer the question.

Here's how you can proceed:

**1. Deeper Dive into Existing Documents:**

* **Review the full text of the company's annual reports:** These reports often include details on the composition of the board committees, including the Audit Committee. Look for biographical information of committee members and their roles within the company to infer if there's a pattern of excluding executive directors.
* **Examine the company's Articles of Association:** This legal document defines the structure and governance of the company. It might contain clauses about the eligibility criteria for Audit Committee members.
* **Analyze the company's corporate governance code:**  Many companies, even if not explicitly stated as policies, include corporate governance codes or best practices. These guidelines might shed light on the desired composition of the Audit Committee.

**2.  Seek Information Directly:**

* **Contact the company's Investor Relations department:** They are best positioned to provide clarification on this specific question regarding the Audit Committee's composition and selection criteria.  Explain your research and the ambiguity you've encountered.
* **Review the company's filings with the relevant stock exchange(s):**  These filings often contain additional information about corporate governance and board committees beyond what's on the company's general website.

**3.  Consider Legal Interpretation:**

* While there's no explicit prohibition in the documents you've reviewed,  consider consulting with a legal professional specializing in corporate governance and securities law. They can offer an opinion on whether the current practices of the company comply with applicable regulations, even in the absence of an explicit policy.

**In your response:**  It's crucial to state explicitly that your research has been thorough but hasn't yielded a definitive answer from publicly available information.  Then, clearly outline the additional steps you've taken (or plan to take) to obtain the necessary information, highlighting the reasons why these steps are necessary given the lack of a clear policy statement.  Your final conclusion should acknowledge that further research is needed to provide a completely definitive answer.

That's a good rephrasing. Here are a few more options, each with slightly different emphasis:

**Option 1 (Focus on potential conflicts):**

> ""Does the 2024 annual report for [Company Name] disclose any relationships between key management personnel or board members and significant suppliers or vendors that could create a conflict of interest?  If so, please provide specific details and page numbers.""


**Option 2 (More direct and concise):**

> ""Review the 2024 annual report of [Company Name] for disclosures of relationships between key management/board members and suppliers/vendors that might influence business decisions.  Cite specific examples and page numbers if found.""


**Option 3 (Emphasis on the type of information sought):**

* **Social and environmental parameters:**  The policy states that suppliers will be screened based on social and environmental criteria, including volume of procurement and substitutability.

Once you locate the policy,  search for keywords such as:

* ""external auditor""
* ""independent audit""
* ""audit committee"" (to see if the committee's review involves external audit)
* ""material related party transactions review""


Look for any section dealing with the review and approval process for material related party transactions.  The presence or absence of language explicitly mentioning external auditors will answer the question.

Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ","The dividend payout ratio for the year ended 31st March 2023 is not explicitly stated in the provided document.  However, to calculate it, we need the total dividends distributed and the net profit, both from the consolidated financial statements.

On **page 139**, the consolidated statement of profit and loss shows a consolidated profit after tax of ₹1,269.14 Crore.

On **page 139**, the consolidated balance sheet shows total equity attributable to the owners of the company as ₹18,636.40 Crore.  There's mention of a dividend of ₹100 per share. However, there is no information available to calculate the total amount paid out as dividends.  More information is required to ascertain the precise number of shares and calculate the dividend payout ratio.
You're right, the dividend payout ratio isn't explicitly stated in the Shree Cement Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23.  To calculate it, you need to gather the following information from the report:

**1. Net Income (Profit After Tax):** This is the company's profit after deducting all expenses and taxes.  You can find this figure in:

* **Standalone Financial Statements:** Page 199 (Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss) shows the profit after tax.
* **Consolidated Financial Statements:** Page 263 (Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss)  shows the profit after tax.  Remember to use the *standalone* figures if you specifically want the standalone payout ratio.  The consolidated numbers include the results of subsidiaries.

**2. Dividends Paid:** This is the total amount of dividends the company paid out to its shareholders during the fiscal year.  This information is spread across several sections:

* **Page 12 (Chairman's Message):** Mentions a dividend payout of ₹100 per share.  You'll need to calculate the total dividend paid using the number of outstanding shares.
* **Page 120 (Performance Highlights):** Shows dividend per share graphically.
* **Page 226 (Standalone Financial Statements, Note 19):** Provides details on shares outstanding.  You will need to multiply the number of shares by the dividend per share to get the total dividend paid.
* **Page 295 (Annexure A to the Notice):**  Further confirms the dividend amount.

**Calculation:**

Once you have the net income and total dividends paid, the dividend payout ratio is calculated as follows:


**Dividend Payout Ratio = (Total Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100**

The result will be expressed as a percentage.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Standalone vs. Consolidated:**  Choose either the standalone or consolidated figures consistently. The consolidated report will include results from subsidiaries, while the standalone only reflects the parent company's performance.
* **Share Count:** Make sure you're using the correct number of outstanding shares.  The report provides this number in Note 19 of the financial statements.  Pay close attention to the year-end share count.
* **Interim vs. Final Dividends:**  The report mentions both interim and final dividends.  Be sure to include *all* dividends paid during the fiscal year in your calculation.


Remember to double-check all figures and ensure you're using data from the correct fiscal year (2022-23).  If any discrepancies occur or you require further clarity, it is best to refer to a financial professional or directly contact the company's investor relations department.

However, the **Remuneration Policy of Shree Cement Limited** mentions the annual evaluation of the board's performance, including that of its committees.  This does not explicitly state an annual affirmation of independence, but the evaluation process might incorporate aspects of independence review.  Therefore, while there isn't a direct answer from the provided documents, the annual performance evaluation may indirectly touch upon board independence.
That's excellent investigative work.  Your summary accurately reflects the situation: Shree Cement doesn't appear to have a dedicated, standalone policy explicitly titled ""Board Independence Policy"" that mandates annual affirmation. However, the indirect evidence you've gathered from the Corporate Governance policy and the Board of Directors' Responsibilities statement strongly suggests a commitment to Board independence.

The fact that the Corporate Governance policy mentions the importance of independence and the Board's responsibility for ensuring a majority of independent directors indicates that independence is a key consideration.  The Board of Directors' Responsibilities statement further reinforces this.

To make your findings even stronger for someone researching this topic:

* **Specify the exact wording from the policies:**  Instead of summarizing, quote the relevant sections from the ""Corporate Governance"" and ""Board of Directors' Responsibilities"" documents. This provides stronger evidence.

* **Analyze the implications:** Briefly discuss what the absence of a formal, annual affirmation policy might suggest.  This could include discussing the potential for oversight, or perhaps the existing mechanisms used to ensure independence.  This shows a deeper understanding of corporate governance best practices.

* **Compare to best practices:**  Consider mentioning widely accepted corporate governance best practices regarding board independence (e.g.,  the composition of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, director independence evaluations) and how Shree Cement's policies align (or don't align) with these.

In conclusion, while Shree Cement lacks a specific, explicitly titled policy for annual affirmation of Board independence, your research reveals strong, albeit indirect, evidence of their commitment to the principle of board independence through their other policies and statements.

**CEO Compensation:**  The annual compensation of the Chief Executive Officer (Managing Director) for FY 2023-24 is ₹1,967.29 Lac (₹196.73 million).  This information is found on page 23 of the annual report.

**Ratio Calculation (R2):**

R2 = CEO Compensation / Net Profit

My apologies for the lack of clarity in my original request.  I am interested in the ratio of long-term incentives to total compensation for the CEO of Shree Cement Limited as reported in their most recent annual report (March 31st, 2024).

Specifically, I'd like to understand the proportion of the CEO's total compensation that comes from:

* **Short-term incentives:** Salary, bonuses, and other short-term cash payments.
* **Long-term incentives:** Stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based bonuses with vesting periods longer than one year, and other long-term compensation arrangements.

The goal is to calculate the ratio:  `Long-term incentives / Total compensation`.

I understand this information may not be explicitly presented in a single table, and may require aggregating figures from different sections of the report.  Thank you for your help!

Based on the Shree Cement Limited Annual Report (as of 31st March 2024):

* **FYE (Financial Year End):**  31st March 2024 (Page 4)
* **Last AGM (Annual General Meeting) Scheduled:** 6th August 2024 (Page 1)

**Gap Calculation:**

To calculate the gap, let's consider the number of days between March 31st and August 6th, 2024.

* March has 31 days. Days remaining in March = 0 (31-31)
* April has 30 days
* May has 31 days
* June has 30 days
* July has 31 days
* August has 6 days

Total number of days = 0 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 6 = 128 days

Therefore, there is a gap of **128 days** between the last financial year end and the last scheduled AGM."
