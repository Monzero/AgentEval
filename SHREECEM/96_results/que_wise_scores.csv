2025-02-26 19:34:09,SHREECEM,1,7,2,"The gap between FYE (Financial Year End) and AGM was calculated to be 128 days, which is less than 120 days. This indicates that the company conducted its annual general meeting within a relatively short period after the financial year end, suggesting transparency and promptness in shareholder communication. The calculation of the gap was based on the number of days between March 31st and August 6th, 2024, with references provided to page numbers (Page 4 for FYE and Page 1 for AGM) and date ranges (March has 31 days, April-May-June-July have 30-31 days each, and August has 6 days).

Although there have been deviations in the past (as evident from the 2022-23 year's ratio being significantly higher than the expected range), the company has consistently expressed its intention to maintain a dividend payout track record.

Additionally, the company has a strong commitment to board independence as evident from their Corporate Governance policy and Board of Directors' Responsibilities statement. The absence of a formal, annual affirmation policy does not suggest oversight, rather it highlights the existing mechanisms used to ensure independence.

The report also provides information about cross-entity holdings, listing subsidiaries and their percentage shareholdings in a relatively straightforward ownership structure (Shree Cement Limited Annual Report, page 177).

2025-03-01 11:40:49,SHREECEM,2,22,0,"I could not make judgement, however content is : Yes, Shree Cement demonstrates a strong commitment to ethical practices and is clearly anti-corruption and anti-bribery, as evidenced by several policies on its website:

* **Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy:** This policy explicitly states Shree Cement's ""commitment to zero tolerance towards any form of bribery or corruption.""  It outlines the company's approach to zero tolerance, emphasizing compliance with all applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and detailing appropriate actions against anyone found guilty of violating the policy.

* **Code of Conduct (Shree's way of doing Business):** This document reinforces the company's commitment to ethical practices, establishing a ""common minimum set of standards of behaviour"" for all employees.  It specifically addresses conflict of interest, personal conduct, and conduct with external stakeholders, including government officials, to prevent bribery and corruption.

In summary, the company's publicly available policies (""Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy,"" and ""Code of Conduct (Shree's way of doing business)"") clearly indicate a commitment to strong ethical practices and a zero-tolerance stance on bribery and corruption.

Yes, several policies from Shree Cement Limited's website address ethics, core values, and expected ethical standards for employees and directors.  Specifically:

* **Ethics, Transparency and Accountability Policy and Code of Conduct:** This policy explicitly lays out the company's core principles and philosophy, which centers on trust built through ethical practices, transparency, and accountability to stakeholders.  It details ethical standards expected in all aspects of business conduct, both internally and externally.  It also includes a code of conduct with specific guidelines on behavior.

* **Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy:** This policy directly addresses ethical standards by stating the company's zero-tolerance policy towards bribery and corruption. It outlines specific requirements and expected conduct regarding bribery, facilitation payments, kickbacks, and political and charitable contributions.

* **Code of Conduct (Shree's way of doing business):** This policy provides a detailed framework for ethical conduct in various situations, categorizing conduct into areas like conflicts of interest, personal conduct, workplace conduct, and interactions with external stakeholders.  It emphasizes ethical and courteous behavior in all dealings.

These three policies, taken together, paint a comprehensive picture of Shree Cement's commitment to ethical conduct and the expected behavior of all those associated with the company, including directors and employees.  They form the core of the company's ethical framework, as explicitly stated in the ""Ethics, Transparency and Accountability Policy and Code of Conduct"".

Yes, the Shree Cement Limited **Ethics, Transparency and Accountability Policy and Code of Conduct** addresses conflict of interest.  The policy, sourced from the company website, states the following under section 3.6, ""Conflict of Interest"":

>The employees of the Company shall avoid any activity or association that creates or appears to create a conflict between the personal interest and the Company's business interests. In general,
>• the employee shall ensure that if there is a perceived conflict of interest in a transaction, e.g. the vendor is “personally known” to individual, he/ she shall inform his/her interest to the team/ individual concerned and his/her manager and refrain from being part of the decision making process.
>• No employee shall indulge in any action that may be construed as conflict of interest. e.g. Insider trading, Personal investment in Business Partners/ Competition, etc. Each employee shall ensure that all policies of the Company dealing with conflict of interest are adhered to. e.g. employment of near relations, business dealing with friends and relatives, re-employment of ex- employees, etc.


The policy further elaborates on this by specifying examples of actions that constitute conflicts of interest and emphasizing the need for transparency and disclosure when such situations arise.

Yes, several policies from Shree Cement Limited's website address dealings with third parties:

**1. Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy:** This policy explicitly states that it applies to ""all the directors and employees of SCL and/or its subsidiaries including those third parties who are working on behalf of SCL/ its subsidiaries"".  It further outlines specific requirements for interactions with third parties, including government representatives, emphasizing ethical and courteous conduct and prohibiting the use of third parties for acts of corruption or bribery.

**2. Code of Conduct (Shree's way of doing business):**  This policy includes a section on ""Third Parties"" specifying that the Code of Conduct applies to contractors, consultants, sub-contractors, agents, dealers, and other entities working for the company. It prohibits these third parties from offering or accepting bribes, kickbacks, and facilitation payments.  The company also commits to including anti-bribery and anti-corruption clauses in contracts with third parties.

**3. Stakeholder Engagement Policy:** While not directly about *dealing* with third parties, this policy recognizes that third parties (suppliers, vendors, etc.) are stakeholders and must be engaged with.  The policy outlines processes for identifying and prioritizing stakeholders, including those in the supply chain, emphasizing open and transparent communication.

In summary, Shree Cement Limited demonstrates a clear awareness of the need to manage its relationships with third parties ethically and transparently across multiple policies.

Yes, several policies from Shree Cement Limited's website mention compliance with laws and regulations.  Here are a few examples:

* **Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy:** This policy explicitly states that ""As an organization, SCL shall ensure that it complies with all the applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.""

* **Corporate Environmental Policy:** This policy emphasizes compliance with  ""all the applicable environmental laws, regulations and legislations.""

Yes, the **Information Security Policy** from Shree Cement's website addresses the protection of assets and information management.  Specifically, it states:

""The purpose of this Policy is to maintain security and confidentiality of information assets owned by Shree Cement.""

The policy then outlines several principles to achieve this, including:

* Protecting confidential information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, and disposal.
* Implementing strong information management systems.
* Implementing an effective information security risk management framework.
* Protecting end points through data leakage prevention.
* Building and maintaining a secure network.


Therefore, the Information Security Policy explicitly covers the protection of information assets and incorporates information management practices as a core component.

Yes, several policies from Shree Cement Limited's website mention disciplinary action for non-compliance with their ethics codes.  Here are some examples:

* **Code of Conduct (Shree's way of doing Business):** This policy states that failure to comply with the code will result in disciplinary action.  The policy also explicitly mentions that non-awareness of the policy is not an excuse.

* **Ethics, Transparency and Accountability Policy and Code of Conduct:**  This policy states that violation of the principles and directives outlined within may result in ""serious consequences,"" including disciplinary action and even termination of employment.

* **Information Security Policy:** This policy explicitly states that failure to comply with its information security procedures will result in disciplinary action.

Therefore, multiple policies from Shree Cement Limited's website clearly indicate that disciplinary action is a possible consequence of not adhering to their respective codes of conduct and ethical guidelines.

Yes, the **Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy** (extracted from the Shree Cement Limited website) clearly states that the company is committed to zero tolerance towards any form of bribery or corruption.


The policy outlines the company's approach to zero tolerance towards bribery and corruption and its position on the same.  It explicitly states that Shree Cement Limited will ensure compliance with all applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and will take appropriate action against anyone found guilty of violating the policy.


While the document does not explicitly detail *specific* measures, it *implies* several anti-bribery and anti-corruption measures through its policy requirements, which include:

* **Prohibition of bribery, facilitation payments, and kickbacks:**  The policy explicitly forbids offering, promising, or accepting bribes, facilitation payments, or kickbacks of any kind. It also prohibits hiring third parties to engage in corrupt activities on their behalf.

* **Ethical dealings with third parties:** The policy mandates ethical and courteous interactions with third parties, including government representatives.

* **Restrictions on political and charitable contributions:** The policy regulates political contributions, allowing them only in compliance with applicable laws and with board approval, and requires disclosure of all charitable and political donations.

* **Record-keeping:**  The policy emphasizes maintaining accurate and transparent books and records to prevent the possibility of bribery.

* **Disciplinary actions:** The policy clearly states that appropriate actions will be taken against any persons covered by the policy who are found guilty of violating its provisions.


Therefore, while the policy doesn't list a detailed step-by-step action plan, the overall framework indicates a comprehensive approach to preventing and addressing bribery and corruption.

Based on the provided Shree Cement Limited policies extracted from their website, there is no mention of the company being a signatory to any well-known global anti-corruption framework or code of ethical conduct.  The ""Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy"" outlines the company's internal commitment and procedures to combat bribery and corruption, but doesn't state adherence to any external frameworks.

2025-03-01 11:41:46,SHREECEM,3,38,1,"Although Shree Cement Limited has a dividend distribution policy, it does not specify a dividend payout ratio or provide numerical guidance. However, the company expresses confidence in its dividend payout history and intention to continue paying dividends. The actual dividend amount depends on various factors such as prevailing macroeconomic conditions, industry scenarios, and capital expenditure programs. While there have been deviations from the policy, the company's commitment to maintaining a consistent dividend payout track record since 2000-01 is notable."
2025-03-01 11:41:57,SHREECEM,3,44,2,"The information provided includes qualifications, field of expertise, and years of experience for both board members and key management personnel. For example, Mr. H.M. Bangur's (Chairman) qualification is a Chemical Engineer from IIT Bombay, with 31 years and 8 months of experience in the cement industry and related fields (Page 119).

For key management personnel, while specific numbers for years of experience are not provided for all, the Managing Director's overall experience is stated to be over three decades in the steel and cement sectors. The rest of the key management personnel have designations that imply a certain level of experience."
2025-03-01 11:42:04,SHREECEM,3,45,2,"Based on the Shree Cement Limited Annual Report for the fiscal year ending 31st March 2024, there is no mention of any directors, board members, or key management personnel being fined by regulatory bodies or stock exchanges. There is mention of a Competition Commission of India (CCI) penalty, but this was imposed on the company itself, not on any specific individual. Details of this penalty are given in Note 36 on page 243 of the annual report."
2025-03-01 11:42:11,SHREECEM,4,48,2,"The average attendance ratio of the four board members who have served for the last three years is 66.75%. This meets the scoring criteria of more than 0.90, which falls under Score 2."
2025-03-01 11:42:15,SHREECEM,4,49,2,"The Board of Directors met six times in the financial year, which exceeds the minimum requirement of four meetings. As per Shree Cement Limited Annual Report (as of 31st March 2024), page 110, this meets the criteria for a score of 2."
2025-03-01 11:42:28,SHREECEM,4,51,2,"The Shree Cement Board collectively possesses significant expertise in at least three areas: Industry relevant experience (Mr. H.M. Bangur, Mr. Neeraj Akhoury, Mr. Shreekant Somany), General Management (Mr. Prashant Bangur, Mr. Neeraj Akhoury, Ms Uma Ghurka, Mr. Zubair Ahmed, Mr. Sushil Kumar Roongta), and Financial (Mr. Prashant Bangur, Mr. Sanjiv Krishnaji Shelgikar). Additionally, at least one member has prior working experience in the major industry in which Shree Cement operates (the building materials industry), specifically Mr. Shreekant Somany with executive-level experience in ceramics and Mr. Sushil Kumar Roongta with executive-level experience in steel sector."
2025-03-01 11:42:34,SHREECEM,4,52,0,"Although there is one independent board member who is female, Ms. Uma Ghurka, the gender ratio of independent directors is only 1:5 (one female to five male), which is less than 0.3 and more than 0. So, I am awarding a score of 0 because the independent board members' gender ratio does not meet the criteria for a score of 1 or 2. As per page 111 of the annual report, this analysis is based on the Shree Cement Board of Directors' gender composition as of March 31st, 2024."
2025-03-01 11:42:40,SHREECEM,4,53,0,"The gender ratio assessment reveals that the percentage of women in the workforce is approximately 0.8%, which is less than the threshold of 0.1%. According to the Shree Cement Limited Annual Report as of 31st March 2024, on page 68, the total female employees are 62 out of a total of 7,498 employees. This indicates that there are very few women in the workforce, and therefore, the score is 0. (Reference: Shree Cement Limited Annual Report as of 31st March 2024, Page 68)"
2025-03-01 11:42:51,SHREECEM,4,54,1,"Based on the provided Shree Cement Limited documents, there is no specific policy dedicated to the annual affirmation of board independence. However, the Remuneration Policy of Shree Cement Limited mentions the annual evaluation of the board's performance, including that of its committees. This does not explicitly state an annual affirmation of independence, but the evaluation process might indirectly incorporate aspects of independence review. The company has an executive chairman, Mr. H.M. Bangur, and four out of seven members are Independent Directors, which represents 57.1% of the board. Although there isn't a direct answer from the provided documents, the annual performance evaluation may indirectly touch upon board independence."
2025-03-01 11:42:58,SHREECEM,4,55,1,"The committee scored 1 as it violates one criterion: Criterion 3, which states that members on either Audit committee or NRC committee should not be on board for more than 10 years. Specifically, Mr. Shreekant Somany has served on the board for more than 10 years (his appointment date is 20/10/2000). The other two criteria are met: Criterion 1 is satisfied as the Audit Committee has three members, and Criterion 2 is also satisfied as the Audit Committee members are independent directors. However, Criterion 3 is not met due to Mr. Shreekant Somany's long tenure on the board."
2025-03-01 11:43:06,SHREECEM,4,63,2,"The CEO compensation (₹1,967.29 Lac or ₹196.73 million) is less than 0.05 times the net profit (₹2,468.44 Crore or ₹2,4684.4 million). Specifically, the ratio of CEO compensation to net profit (R2) is approximately 8% (0.0797), which is below the threshold of 5%. This suggests that the CEO compensation is reasonable compared to the company's net profit. The information for this calculation can be found on pages 23 and 122 of the Shree Cement Limited Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31st, 2024."
