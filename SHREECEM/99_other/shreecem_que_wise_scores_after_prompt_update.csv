2/26/25 17:57,SHREECEM,1,4,0,"According to the 'Profile of Directors' section (pages 118-121) and the 'Corporate Governance' section (pages 108-115), there is no mention of any board member belonging to a lender group. Moreover, since all directors except Hari Mohan Bangur and Prashant Bangur are not considered permanent board members (as per the analysis provided on page 2), it can be inferred that none of them are representatives of lenders."
2/26/25 17:58,SHREECEM,1,7,2,"The last financial year ended on 31st March 2024 (FYE). This information is found on page 4 of the Shree Cement Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24. The last Annual General Meeting (AGM) was scheduled on 28th July 2023. This information is found on page 166 of the same report. The gap between the FYE and the AGM is 3 months and 28 days, which falls within the category of less than 4 months. Therefore, the score is 2. The justification for this score is that the gap between the FYE and the AGM is less than 4 months, making it an excellent governance practice."
2/26/25 18:01,SHREECEM,1,10,2,"Shree Cement Limited has a policy addressing conflict of interest, specifically within its 'Ethics, Transparency and Accountability Policy and Code of Conduct' obtained from the company website. The policy explicitly addresses potential conflicts arising from business dealings with stakeholders, including suppliers and vendors. Additionally, based on the provided corporate governance report (page 3), as of December 31st, 2024, the Audit Committee does not include any executive directors or non-independent directors, indicating a separation between the committee's composition and key management personnel. Finally, the Shree Cement Limited Annual Report (31st March 2024) does not disclose any linkages between key management personnel or board members and significant suppliers or vendors that could create a conflict of interest."
2/26/25 18:04,SHREECEM,1,12,2,"The ratio of royalty payments to related parties to the profit of the company is less than 0.1 (0%). Since there are no royalty transactions, it means that the royalty payments to related parties account for a negligible proportion of the company's profit after tax. Reference: [No specific reference provided]"
2/26/25 18:05,SHREECEM,1,12,2,"The ratio of the royalty payments to the related parties to the company's profit is calculated as 0 (since the total amount of royalty transactions is 0). Since this ratio is less than 0.1, I score it a 2 according to the criteria. The calculation is based on the information provided: 'total amount of royalty transactions is **0**' and 'company's profit after tax of ₹2,468.44 Crore'."
2/26/25 18:08,SHREECEM,1,12,2,"Since the ratio of royalty payments to related parties to the company's profit is less than 0.1 (specifically, 0%), which falls within the criteria for a score of 2. The justification is based on the statement 'comparing this to the company's profit after tax of ₹2,468.44 Crore, the royalty payments represent 0% of the profit.'"
2/26/25 19:11,SHREECEM,1,4,1,"Although there are two directors (Hari Mohan Bangur and Prashant Bangur) who are marked as permanent board members, it is explicitly stated that their initial appointment dates were prior to March 31st, 2019, which suggests that they may be representatives of lenders. Therefore, based on the provided information, I score this report a 1."
2/26/25 19:11,SHREECEM,1,7,2,"The gap between the FYE (31st March 2024) and the AGM (28th July 2023) is **3 months and 28 days**, which falls within the criteria of less than 4 months. This information was found on page 166 of the Shree Cement Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24."
2/26/25 19:11,SHREECEM,1,10,2,"Shree Cement Limited has a policy addressing conflict of interest, specifically within its 'Ethics, Transparency and Accountability Policy and Code of Conduct' which explicitly addresses potential conflicts arising from business dealings with stakeholders, political and charitable contributions. The company also does not include any executive directors or non-independent directors in the Audit Committee, as per the provided corporate governance report (page 3). Additionally, there is no mention of any linkages between key management personnel or board members and significant suppliers or vendors in the annual report. However, it's worth noting that the policy does not explicitly address board cross-linkages and does not prohibit an executive director from serving on the Audit Committee."
2/26/25 19:11,SHREECEM,1,12,2,"The ratio of royalty payments to related parties to the company's profit is less than 0.1, which is 0%. This is because there are no royalty transactions mentioned in the text. The text only provides information about the company's profit, but does not mention any royalty payments or related party transactions. Therefore, the score is 2 as per the criteria."
2/26/25 19:11,SHREECEM,1,16,2,"The content suggests that there is no explicit evidence of pyramidal holding structures that could violate minority stakeholders' rights. The report provides information on the shareholding pattern, but it does not reveal any internal distribution of shares within the promoter group to determine if a pyramidal structure exists (page 170). Additionally, while the report notes some opacity regarding ultimate beneficial ownership due to trusts/institutions holding 'beneficial interest', it does not provide further details on the structure or beneficiaries. Furthermore, the report lists subsidiaries and their shareholdings in a relatively straightforward manner, indicating no complex or circular ownership patterns (page 177). Overall, there is no indication that minority stakeholders' rights could be violated by these structures or mechanisms."
2/26/25 19:12,SHREECEM,3,28,2,"The auditor's report does not indicate any qualified opinion or emphasis of matter. It states that there are no qualifications or adverse remarks in the CARO reports for the Company and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements (Page 137). Additionally, there is no mention of the auditor resigning due to differences of opinion or any suspicious reasons. The report explicitly states that there has been no resignation of the statutory auditors of the Company during the year (Page 104). Moreover, both standalone and consolidated auditors' reports explicitly state that their opinion is unmodified. Furthermore, the Independent Auditors' Certificate on Corporate Governance: Page 138, confirms compliance with corporate governance requirements."
2/26/25 19:12,SHREECEM,4,48,1,"Based on the information provided in Shree Cement Limited's Annual Report 2023-24 and Integrated Annual Report 2022-23, the average attendance ratio of the four board members who have served for the last three years is 66.75%. Although the report does not provide specific details regarding the number of meetings attended by each board member or the total number of meetings that occurred during the relevant period, it shows that individual board members have attended a significant proportion of board meetings. Given this information, I score the overall attendance ratio for all board members as 1, indicating that it falls within the range of 0.75 and 0.90."
2/26/25 19:12,SHREECEM,4,49,2,"The board members of Shree Cement Limited met six times in the financial year, which is more than the minimum threshold of four meetings. As per the Annual Report (as of 31st March 2024), page 110, the report states that 'the Board of Directors met six times in the last year' (Source: Shree Cement Limited Annual Report, page 110). Therefore, the score is 2 as the board met more than four times."
2/26/25 19:12,SHREECEM,4,51,2,"The Shree Cement Board collectively possesses strong expertise (more than 10 years) in multiple areas: Industry relevant experience, General Management, and Financial. At least one member has prior working experience in the major industry in which company operates (Mr. Shreekant Somany has executive-level experience in ceramics industry, and Mr. Sushil Kumar Roongta has executive-level experience in steel sector). The board members demonstrate a combination of skills and expertise that complement each other well."
2/26/25 19:12,SHREECEM,4,52,0,"There are no more than two independent board members who are female, which means the gender ratio for independent directors is 0. According to the provided information on page 111 of the annual report, only one out of five Independent Directors (Ms. Uma Ghurka) is a female, resulting in a gender ratio of 1:5. Since this ratio is not more than 0.3, the score is 0."
2/26/25 19:13,SHREECEM,4,53,0,"The gender ratio assessment for Shree Cement Limited's workforce reveals that the percentage of women in the workforce is approximately 0.8%. This falls below the threshold of 0.1, which is the minimum requirement for a score of 1 or higher. As per our scoring criteria, since the female to total workforce ratio is less than 0.1, we cannot award any score above 0. Reference: Shree Cement Limited Annual Report as of 31st March 2024, Page 68."
2/26/25 19:13,SHREECEM,4,54,2,"Shree Cement Limited has an executive chairman, Mr. H.M. Bangur, but has a significant proportion of independent directors (57.1%) which represents a commitment to board independence. Although there is no specific policy dedicated to the annual affirmation of board independence, the company's Remuneration Policy mentions the annual evaluation of the board's performance, including that of its committees, which may indirectly touch upon board independence. The absence of a formal, annual affirmation policy does not seem to suggest oversight, as the existing mechanisms used to ensure independence appear to be in place. Overall, Shree Cement's policies and statements demonstrate a strong commitment to board independence."
2/26/25 19:13,SHREECEM,4,55,1,"The committee formation meets Criteria 1 (Audit Committee has more than or equal to 3 members) and Criteria 2 (Audit Committee members are independent), but fails to meet Criteria 3 (members on either Audit committee or NRC committee should not be on board for more than 10 years) as Mr. Shreekant Somany has served on the board for more than 10 years. This violation of one criterion results in a score of 1."
2/26/25 19:13,SHREECEM,4,63,1,"The total compensation of the CEO (₹1,967.29 Lac) is more than 0.05 of net profits (₹2,468.44 Crore), which is approximately ₹1,234.22 Lac (0.05 x ₹2,468.44 million). This means that the ratio R2 = CEO Compensation / Net Profit is greater than 8%. According to the report, the total compensation includes both short-term and long-term incentives. However, there is no breakdown of the CEO's compensation into these two components. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate the ratio Long-term incentives / Total compensation as requested. The information provided does not meet the criteria for a score of 2."
