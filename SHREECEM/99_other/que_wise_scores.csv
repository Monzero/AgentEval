As per the scoring criteria, since they are permanent board members, the score is 1. However, it's important to note that without explicit disclosure, we cannot assume that they represent lenders.

This means that the gap between the financial year ending and the Annual General Meeting is relatively short, indicating a prompt and efficient process for the company to provide shareholders with timely information.

Additionally, the company has established Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) at all operational locations and reports annually on sexual harassment cases.

The policy also mentions a grievance mechanism and remediation process for addressing non-compliance. Additionally, the 'Supplier Code of Conduct' sets expectations for suppliers regarding labor and human rights, health and safety, ethics and integrity, environmental impact, and product quality.

Additionally, there is no mention of the auditor resigning due to differences of opinion or any suspicious reasons in the provided information. The report emphasizes that the auditors have obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for their opinion (Page 193). Furthermore, Page 198 states that 'we report that there are no qualifications or adverse remarks in these CARO reports.' These statements suggest that the auditor has issued an unqualified opinion without any matter of emphasis, hence scoring 2."
2025-02-26 17:49:59,SHREECEM,3,32,2,"The Shree Cement Limited has a comprehensive policy for Related Party Transactions, which defines ordinary business, materiality of transactions, and requires approval from the Audit Committee. The policy explicitly outlines the definition of 'ordinary course of business' as transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries at arm's length, which do not require prior approval. It also defines 'Material modification(s)' and 'Material Related Party Transactions', setting thresholds based on financial value relative to the company's turnover. Moreover, the policy mentions the involvement of external auditors in preparing the financial statements used for threshold determination, although it does not mandate a review by external auditors of material related party transactions. The only aspect missing is explicit mention of external auditor review."
2025-02-26 17:50:06,SHREECEM,3,36,1,"Although the annual report does not explicitly list the names of the top 10 shareholders, it provides a breakdown by shareholder category on page 172-173. Additionally, the report indicates that the information about the top 10 individual shareholders is available from the Registrar and Share Transfer Agent (RTA). This meets one of the criteria, i.e., availability of either shareholding pattern or top 10 shareholder names."

2025-02-26 17:50:25,SHREECEM,3,38,2,"The company has a dividend distribution policy that does not specify a dividend payout ratio, but it talks about their aim to continue sharing profits with shareholders through consistent and regular dividend payouts. The actual dividend amount depends on factors such as prevailing macroeconomic conditions, industry scenarios, and capital expenditure programs. Although the policy does not provide numerical guidance, the company has followed its policy in the past three years without any deviations (except for rounding differences). The rationale for deviation is also provided in the form of a brief explanation of how the dividend payout ratio was calculated."
2025-02-26 17:50:37,SHREECEM,3,44,2,"The information available for both board members and key management personnel indicates that qualifications, field of expertise, and number of years of experience in the field are provided. For instance, Mr. H.M. Bangur (Chairman) has a Chemical Engineer degree from IIT Bombay with overall experience of 31 years and 8 months. Similarly, Ms. Uma Ghurka (Independent Director) has B. Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras with over 40 years of experience. For key management personnel, though specific numbers for years of experience are not provided, designations imply a level of experience. For example, Mr. Neeraj Akhoury (Managing Director) has overall experience in the steel and cement sectors, while Mr. Sanjay Mehta (President, Procurement & Corporate Affairs) is assumed to have significant experience based on his designation."
2025-02-26 17:50:42,SHREECEM,3,45,2,"Based on the Shree Cement Limited Annual Report for the fiscal year ending 31st March 2024, there is no mention of any directors, board members, or key management personnel being fined by regulatory bodies or stock exchanges. The report does mention a Competition Commission of India (CCI) penalty imposed on the company itself, not on any specific individual, as detailed in Note 36 on page 243. This supports the scoring of 2, indicating that there is no mention of individuals being fined."
2025-02-26 17:51:07,SHREECEM,4,48,2,"Based on the provided data, the average attendance ratio of the four board members who have served for the last three years is 66.75%. Additionally, the attendance ratios of six other board members are all 100%, indicating regular attendance at meetings. Given that the overall attendance ratio is above 0.90, I score this as a 2, with justification that the board members demonstrate excellent attendance and commitment to their roles."
2025-02-26 17:51:11,SHREECEM,4,49,2,"According to the information provided in the Shree Cement Limited Annual Report (as of 31st March 2024) on page 110, it is clear that the Board of Directors met six times in the financial year. Since this exceeds the minimum threshold of four meetings, a score of 2 is justified as the board has demonstrated sufficient frequency of meetings to ensure effective governance and oversight."

Specifically, Mr. H.M. Bangur, Mr. Neeraj Akhoury, and Mr. Shreekant Somany have extensive experience in the cement and related industries. Additionally, multiple board members demonstrate broad general management skills (Mr. Prashant Bangur, Ms Uma Ghurka, Mr. Zubair Ahmed, and Mr. Sushil Kumar Roongta). Moreover, two board members (Mr. Prashant Bangur and Mr. Sanjiv Krishnaji Shelgikar) have significant financial expertise. Furthermore, at least one member has prior working experience in the major industry in which company operates (Mr. Shreekant Somany has executive-level experience in the ceramics industry)."
2025-02-26 17:51:29,SHREECEM,4,52,0,"The gender ratio of Independent Directors is 1:5, which means that there is only one female independent director, Ms. Uma Ghurka, out of a total of six male independent directors. This is less than the threshold of 0.3 for scoring 1, so I score this as 0. Since there are no more than 0.3 female independent directors, it's clear that the gender ratio for independent director is 0."
2025-02-26 17:51:34,SHREECEM,4,53,0,"The gender ratio assessment reveals that the Shree Cement Limited has a very low proportion of female employees, with only 0.8% (62 out of 7,498) representing women in the total workforce. This falls short of the threshold for scores 1 and 2 as per our criteria, which requires a minimum female-to-total workforce ratio of 0.1. Consequently, we assign a score of 0. The reference for this assessment is the Shree Cement Limited Annual Report as of 31st March 2024, page 68."
2025-02-26 17:51:46,SHREECEM,4,54,1,"Based on the Shree Cement Limited's Integrated Annual Report 2023-24, the company has an executive chairman, Mr. H.M. Bangur. As of 31st March 2024, the Shree Cement Board had seven members, four of whom were Independent Directors, representing 57.1% of the board. Although there is no specific policy dedicated to the annual affirmation of board independence, the Remuneration Policy mentions the annual evaluation of the board's performance, which may indirectly touch upon board independence. Additionally, vintage members (those on the board for more than 10 years) provide a declaration confirming their independence as specified under Section 149(6) of the Companies Act, 2013 and SEBI regulations. This indicates that Shree Cement has some mechanisms in place to ensure the independence of its board members."
2025-02-26 17:51:52,SHREECEM,4,55,1,"The Audit Committee meets criteria 1 as it has three independent members. However, Criteria 2 is violated because the NRC committee includes both executive and non-executive directors, not just independent members. Additionally, Criteria 3 is also violated because Mr. Shreekant Somany, a member of the Audit Committee, has served on the board for more than 10 years. Only one criteria is violated, so the score is 1."
2025-02-26 17:52:00,SHREECEM,4,63,1,"The total compensation of CEO is ₹1,967.29 Lac (₹196.73 million), which is more than 0.05 of net profits (₹2,468.44 Crore or ₹2,4684.4 million). Specifically, the ratio R2 = 0.0797, which is less than 0.05. Therefore, according to the scoring criteria, the score is 1. The justification for this score is that the CEO compensation (₹196.73 million) is more than 0.05 of net profits (₹2,468.44 Crore or ₹2,4684.4 million).

Moreover, since all directors except Hari Mohan Bangur and Prashant Bangur are not considered permanent board members (as per the analysis provided on page 2), it can be inferred that none of them are representatives of lenders."
2025-02-26 17:58:31,SHREECEM,1,7,2,"The last financial year ended on 31st March 2024 (FYE). This information is found on page 4 of the Shree Cement Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24. The last Annual General Meeting (AGM) was scheduled on 28th July 2023. This information is found on page 166 of the same report. The gap between the FYE and the AGM is 3 months and 28 days, which falls within the category of less than 4 months. Therefore, the score is 2. The justification for this score is that the gap between the FYE and the AGM is less than 4 months, making it an excellent governance practice."

The policy explicitly addresses potential conflicts arising from business dealings with stakeholders, including suppliers and vendors. Additionally, based on the provided corporate governance report (page 3), as of December 31st, 2024, the Audit Committee does not include any executive directors or non-independent directors, indicating a separation between the committee's composition and key management personnel. Finally, the Shree Cement Limited Annual Report (31st March 2024) does not disclose any linkages between key management personnel or board members and significant suppliers or vendors that could create a conflict of interest."
2025-02-26 18:04:43,SHREECEM,1,12,2,"The ratio of royalty payments to related parties to the profit of the company is less than 0.1 (0%).

Additionally, there is no mention of any linkages between key management personnel or board members and significant suppliers or vendors in the annual report.

This is because there are no royalty transactions mentioned in the text. The text only provides information about the company's profit, but does not mention any royalty payments or related party transactions. Therefore, the score is 2 as per the criteria."
2025-02-26 19:11:48,SHREECEM,1,16,2,"The content suggests that there is no explicit evidence of pyramidal holding structures that could violate minority stakeholders' rights. The report provides information on the shareholding pattern, but it does not reveal any internal distribution of shares within the promoter group to determine if a pyramidal structure exists (page 170). Additionally, while the report notes some opacity regarding ultimate beneficial ownership due to trusts/institutions holding 'beneficial interest', it does not provide further details on the structure or beneficiaries. Furthermore, the report lists subsidiaries and their shareholdings in a relatively straightforward manner, indicating no complex or circular ownership patterns (page 177). Overall, there is no indication that minority stakeholders' rights could be violated by these structures or mechanisms."

The report explicitly states that there has been no resignation of the statutory auditors of the Company during the year (Page 104). Moreover, both standalone and consolidated auditors' reports explicitly state that their opinion is unmodified.

2025-02-26 19:13:29,SHREECEM,4,63,1,"The total compensation of the CEO (₹1,967.29 Lac) is more than 0.05 of net profits (₹2,468.44 Crore), which is approximately ₹1,234.22 Lac (0.05 x ₹2,468.44 million). This means that the ratio R2 = CEO Compensation / Net Profit is greater than 8%. According to the report, the total compensation includes both short-term and long-term incentives. However, there is no breakdown of the CEO's compensation into these two components. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate the ratio Long-term incentives / Total compensation as requested. The information provided does not meet the criteria for a score of 2."
