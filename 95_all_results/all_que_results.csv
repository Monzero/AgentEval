Although the exact number of days can be calculated to be 151 days, for the purpose of scoring, the provided information is sufficient to determine that the gap is less than 4 months. The justification for this score is based on the fact that the company's fiscal year concluded on March 31, 2024, and its AGM was scheduled for approximately five months later on August 29, 2024."

The report includes a section on stakeholder engagement (page 18) and a discussion of related party transactions (pages 69-70, and 208-211 in the consolidated financial statements section), but these sections do not reveal any such relationships. Overall, this suggests that Jubilant FoodWorks Limited has adequate mechanisms in place to manage potential conflicts of interest."

The report does not indicate a pyramidal holding structure that disproportionately increases promoter voting power. The report shows that promoters held 41.94% of the shares as of March 31, 2024. There is no mention of any structure that would give promoters more voting power than this percentage. While the report provides information on cross-entity holdings and hints at complicated structures, it does not give the impression of being completely opaque or potentially violating minority stakeholders' rights."

For the financial year ending March 31, 2022, CSR spending represented 2.009% of its average net profit for the three preceding years.

,2025-03-07 20:05:41,PAYTM,4,63,1,"The CEO's total compensation for FY2023-24 was INR 44.51 crore, which is less than 0.05 of the net loss (INR 14,224 crore) incurred by the company. According to the ratio calculation R2 = -0.00313, the CEO's compensation is only 0.313% of the total net losses incurred. This indicates that the CEO compensation is reasonable and not excessive compared to the company's financial performance. (Source: Paytm Annual Report 2024, Page 104 & Page 22)"
0.0,3/6/25 18:20,TATAMOTORS,1,4,2,"Based on the provided Tata Motors Corporate Governance report (Page 2), all directors are marked as non-permanent board members, with none of them being considered permanent based on their initial appointment dates. The 5-year threshold is used to assess longevity of their appointments, and all directors have appointed within the last 5 years or less. Additionally, a review of the Tata Motors Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 (as of March 31, 2024) found no mention of any board member belonging to a lender group in the 'Board of Directors' section (page 14) and other relevant sections, further supporting the conclusion that all directors are non-permanent."

Therefore, I score this content a 1. The justification for this score is that the gap is not too long (>180 days), but also not too short (<120 days), indicating a reasonable period between financial year end and annual general meeting."
2.0,3/6/25 18:20,TATAMOTORS,1,10,2,"The content suggests that Tata Motors Limited has a policy addressing conflicts of interest with stakeholders, specifically mentioning 'Principle of Balancing Interests', 'Transparency and Disclosure', and 'Specific Examples of Conflicts'. The policy explicitly emphasizes the importance of transparency and disclosure in relationships that might create conflicts of interest. Although there is no explicit mention of board cross-linkages, the principles could be applied to evaluate such situations. Additionally, the company's Corporate Governance report indicates that the Audit Committee does not include any executive directors or non-independent directors as of December 31st, 2024. Furthermore, the Tata Motors Limited Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 (79th) does not disclose any linkages between key management personnel or board members and key suppliers or vendors, competitors, or other stakeholders. Overall, the policy appears to cover all stakeholders, including suppliers and vendors."

Since the ratio of royalty payments to related parties to the company's profit is less than 0.1, we score this as 2, indicating that the royalty payments are a small proportion of the company's profit."
4.0,3/6/25 18:21,TATAMOTORS,1,16,2,"Based on the information provided in the Tata Motors Limited Integrated Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, it appears that there are no structures or mechanisms that could violate minority stakeholders' rights. The report shows a clear holding structure with Tata Sons Private Limited as the ultimate holding company (page 4), and provides a detailed breakdown of the ownership structure within the Tata Motors group of companies (page 7). The visual representation on page 7 and the consolidated data mentioned on page 4 suggest multiple layers of interconnected ownership and financial reporting, but do not imply any unfair treatment of minority stakeholders or potential violation of their rights."
5.0,3/6/25 18:25,TATAMOTORS,2,18,2,"The policies are publicly disclosed and the company has provided information on the number of employee accidents. Tata Motors provides health, safety, and sexual harassment training, although the exact curriculum isn't detailed. The company's commitment to creating a safe and respectful workplace (Dignity and respect point 4 and 5) lays the foundation for a culture of safety, which is crucial for preventing occupation-related harm. Additionally, the company has publicly disclosed its health and safety policies through its Tata Code of Conduct 2015, Human Rights Policy, Whistleblower Policy, Remuneration Policy for Directors, Key Managerial Personnel and Other Employees, and Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR). Although the exact numbers are not explicitly stated, the company provides information about workplace accidents and fatalities in its BRSR section."

Additionally, the annual report provides information on the company's adoption of a policy on prevention, prohibition, and redressal of sexual harassment at workplace (page 129). Although the report does not provide further details on the complaints received during FY24, it does mention that eleven complaints were received, seven of which were closed. Therefore, while Tata Motors' website may not have publicly disclosed its specific policy title for sexual harassment prevention, it has provided some information on its approach to preventing and addressing sexual harassment."
7.0,3/6/25 18:25,TATAMOTORS,2,20,1,"Tata Motors does have policies in place addressing supplier/vendor selection, although these are not compiled into separate dedicated policies. The information is integrated into the broader 'Tata Code of Conduct 2015' and other relevant documents. The Code of Conduct outlines high-level ethical standards and expectations for interactions with suppliers. While it doesn't give specific, detailed selection criteria, it does emphasize fairness, transparency, and adherence to ethical standards in the selection and ongoing management of suppliers and vendors. Additionally, the 'Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy' mentions third-party due diligence, which indirectly touches on supplier vetting."
8.0,3/6/25 18:25,TATAMOTORS,2,21,1,"The report mentions that there were some overdue payments to suppliers, vendors, and other parties, but these were addressed and not considered material. The company's auditor's report does not highlight any material instances of delayed payments as a significant issue impacting the financial health of the company. While some overdue balances are acknowledged, there is no indication that these constitute significant or material unremedied non-compliance."
9.0,3/6/25 18:25,TATAMOTORS,2,22,2,"Tata Motors' publicly available policies (as sourced from their website) clearly articulate a commitment to strong ethical practices, explicitly prohibit bribery and corruption, and detail the consequences of failing to adhere to the stated ethical guidelines. Both policies ('Tata Code of Conduct 2015' and 'Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy') clearly articulate the company's commitment to anti-bribery and anti-corruption measures, with detailed expectations of ethical behavior, compliance with relevant laws, and penalties for violations. The policies also refer to compliance with various international anti-corruption frameworks and laws, demonstrating a commitment to globally recognized ethical conduct."

In FY23, it spent ₹20.81 crore, representing 0.76% of standalone profit after tax. Although the company faced a net loss in FY22, it still spent ₹23.69 crores on CSR activities. The ratio of CSR spending to net profit is more than 0.02 or negative, hence we award a score of 2."

Additionally, based on the provided Tata Motors Corporate Governance report, shareholding information (number of shares and percentage of total shares) is not explicitly provided for individual board members or key management personnel. While the report details the overall shareholding pattern (Page 10-14), it does not break down the holdings for specific individuals on the board or in key management positions.
