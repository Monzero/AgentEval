According to the scoring criteria, a score of 0 is assigned when the gap between FYE and AGM is more than 6 months. Therefore, the content scores 0."
2025-02-25 02:20:35,PCJEWELLER,1,3,0,"Although PC Jeweller Limited has a Code of Conduct that addresses conflict of interest, it lacks specific provisions covering potential conflicts of interest between board members and other stakeholders outside of the direct employee/senior management structure. Additionally, the Nomination and Remuneration Policy does not explicitly prohibit executive directors from serving on the committee, and Balram Garg, an Executive Director, is a member of both the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee. There is no explicit policy or adherence to a policy that covers suppliers and vendors, and no information suggests preferential treatment to specific suppliers based on connections with management or the board."
2025-02-25 02:20:40,PCJEWELLER,1,4,2,"The ratio of the royalty payments to the related parties to the profit of the company cannot be calculated as there are no royalty transactions (0) and the company has a net loss (-629.36 crore).

2025-02-25 02:20:48,PCJEWELLER,1,5,2,"Based on the analysis, it appears that there is no evidence that structures or mechanisms could violate minority stakeholders' rights. The promoter voting rights and pyramidal holding structures are not explicitly detailed in a way that would suggest unfair treatment of minority shareholders. While there is some complexity in the cross-entity holdings, it does not seem to indicate a structure that would violate minority stakeholders' rights."

Although the document doesn't explicitly state that they provide health, safety, and sexual harassment trainings, the existence of policies implies a commitment to these areas."
2025-02-25 02:21:06,PCJEWELLER,2,19,1,"Although the company has a policy addressing sexual harassment in the workplace and has constituted an Internal Complaints Committee for redressal of complaints, the full text of the policy is not publicly disclosed. Additionally, although no complaint was received during the year under review, there is no information provided on the number of sexual harassment incidents. However, the company has taken steps to prevent sexual harassment by adopting a policy against it and having mechanisms in place to address such issues."
2025-02-25 02:21:09,PCJEWELLER,2,20,0,"The content states that there is no specific policy dedicated solely to supplier/vendor selection or management, and the document does not contain this information. Therefore, it can be inferred that policies are not available for both supplier/contractor management and selection."
2025-02-25 02:21:15,PCJEWELLER,2,21,0,"The content indicates that PC Jeweller Limited had delayed repayments to its lenders, specifically mentioning that the accounts were classified as Non-Performing Assets (NPA) in FY 2021-22.

2025-02-25 02:21:34,PCJEWELLER,2,23,1,"The company incurred a net loss in FY2023-24 and FY2022-23, but spent ₹0.94 crore on CSR activities in FY2021-22 despite having a net loss. Since the company did not spend any amount on CSR activities in FY2023-24 due to negative average net profit, we can consider that as an exception. As per the scoring criteria, since the company spends less than 0.02 times of their profit (₹0.94 crore) in CSR activities, the score is 1."
