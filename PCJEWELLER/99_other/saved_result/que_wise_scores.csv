The report explicitly states that there is **no mention** that any board member belongs to a lender group (Page 2). Therefore, based on the provided information, all directors can be classified as non-permanent board members."

This score of 2 is given as the gap is well below the threshold of 180 days. The calculation for the gap was done by subtracting the FYE date from the AGM scheduled date, and the result was 6 months, indicating a very short period between the two events."
2025-02-26 21:33:56,PCJEWELLER,1,10,0,"I could not make judgement, however content is : Yes, PC Jeweller Limited has a policy addressing conflict of interest, specifically within its ""Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management,"" as found on the company website.  

Section 4.2, ""Conflict of Interest,"" states that Directors and Senior Management ""shall not engage in any business, activity or relationship, which may be in conflict with the interest of the Company.""  The policy mandates disclosure to the Board if such a situation arises.  It also prohibits the exploitation of corporate property, information, or position for personal gain without Board disclosure and approval.

However, the provided document does *not* explicitly detail policies regarding board cross-linkages or interlocking directorates.  While the Code of Conduct establishes a framework for ethical conduct, it does not address the specifics of potential conflicts arising from directors serving on multiple boards, potentially impacting related companies.  Therefore, based solely on the provided ""Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management"" document, the existence of a specific policy addressing board cross-linkages cannot be confirmed.

Based on the provided text from PC Jeweller Limited's ""Nomination & Remuneration Policy,"" there's no explicit statement strictly prohibiting an executive director from serving on the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.  The document does not address this specific restriction.

Yes, according to the Corporate Governance report (page 3), as of December 31st, 2024, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee includes one executive director, Balram Garg.  There is no information in this report about non-independent directors in this committee.The provided text is a corporate governance report for PC Jeweller LTD.  as of December 31st, 2024, not March 31st, 2024.

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee, according to the report's Annexure 1,  had the following members as of December 31st, 2024:

* **Sannovanda Machaiah Swathi:** Non-Executive Independent Director (Chairperson)
* **Mahesh Agarwal:** Non-Executive Independent Director
* **Farangi Lal Kansal:** Non-Executive Independent Director

Therefore, as of December 31st, 2024,  **no non-independent directors** served on the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.  The report does not contain information for March 31st, 2024.

Based on the provided text extracted from PC Jeweller Limited's website, there is no explicit policy that strictly prohibits executive directors from serving on the Audit Committee.  However, the ""Nomination & Remuneration Policy"" mentions the composition of the Audit Committee, stating that only Independent Directors will approve Related Party Transactions.  This suggests that while executive directors may be *part* of the Audit Committee, their approval of such transactions is restricted.  More information would be needed to definitively answer the question.

Yes, the corporate governance report for PC Jeweller Ltd. as of December 31, 2024 (Page 3) shows that Balram Garg, an Executive Director, is a member of the Audit Committee.  There is no mention of any non-independent director.
Yes, please attempt to find an answer using the revised query:  ""Does the company have any non-independent members on its Audit Committee?"" using the provided text.
That's a correct interpretation of the provided text from page 3 of PC Jeweller Ltd.'s corporate governance report.  The report clearly states that the Audit Committee consists only of independent directors.

Based on my analysis of the provided PC Jeweller Limited Annual Report (as of 31 March 2024), there is no explicit mention of direct linkages between key management personnel or board members and key suppliers or vendors.

The report does contain a section (Note 37, Related Party Transactions, pages 119-126) detailing transactions with related parties.  However, this section focuses on financial relationships with subsidiaries and certain individuals (identified as Key Management Personnel and Directors).  It doesn't directly show relationships with external suppliers or vendors.  While some related parties might indirectly be involved in the supply chain, there's no information provided to confirm such linkages.

Based on my analysis of the provided PC Jeweller Limited Annual Report (as of 31st March 2024), there is no mention of any linkages between key management personnel or board members and competitors.  The report does not disclose any such relationships.
"
2025-02-26 21:34:02,PCJEWELLER,1,12,2,"Since the total amount of royalty transactions is 0, a comparison with the company's profit (a net loss of ₹629.36 crores) is trivial; 0 is significantly less than the net loss."
2025-02-26 21:34:10,PCJEWELLER,1,16,2,"Based on the Annual Report of PC Jeweller Limited as of 31st March 2024, there is no evidence that suggests a structure or mechanism could violate minority stakeholders' rights. The report clearly outlines the shareholding pattern (page 65) and details of subsidiaries (pages 11, 19). Additionally, it provides information on cross-entity holdings (page 19, Annexure 1), but there's no indication of complicated structures or indirect holdings that would disproportionately increase promoter voting power. Overall, the report appears transparent in its disclosure of ownership structure, which does not give an impression of being opaque to the extent that the ultimate beneficiary cannot be fully determined."
2025-02-26 21:34:21,PCJEWELLER,2,18,2,"The company has publicly disclosed its health and safety policies, including the Business Responsibility Policy which outlines its commitment to providing a safe and healthy working environment (page 9). Although specific preventative measures are not explicitly mentioned, the policy demonstrates a proactive approach to reviewing and improving processes to minimize risks to employee health and safety. Additionally, the policy mentions policies in place such as the 'Whistle Blower Policy' and 'Policy against Sexual Harassment' which indirectly suggest the existence of trainings. While there is no explicit mention of extending health, safety, and welfare initiatives to suppliers and vendors, the Business Responsibility Policy does consider stakeholders' interests, including those of suppliers/vendors."
2025-02-26 21:34:27,PCJEWELLER,2,19,1,"The company has publicly disclosed its prevention of sexual harassment policy, which outlines procedures for making a 'Protected Disclosure' and assures protection from reprisals. Although it does not mention any specific incidents of sexual harassment, it provides information on the number of complaints received (none) during the year under review. The annual report (page 13) specifically states that the company has adopted a policy against sexual harassment and has constituted an Internal Complaints Committee for redressal of complaints. Reference: Annual Report (Page 13)"
2025-02-26 21:34:37,PCJEWELLER,2,20,1,"Although PC Jeweller Limited does not have dedicated policies specifically titled 'Supplier/Vendor Selection Policy' or 'Supplier/Vendor Management Policy', it's acknowledged that the company has indirect references to supplier relations in its Business Responsibility Policy (Source: PC Jeweller Limited's Business Responsibility Policy). The policy mentions the Company's commitment to ethical conduct and fair dealing with stakeholders, which implies a commitment to responsible supplier relationships. However, no explicit supplier selection or management details are given, indicating that policies for both supplier/contractor management and selection are not available. Therefore, I score this as 1, as policies are available for one aspect (supplier relations) but not the other."
2025-02-26 21:34:47,PCJEWELLER,2,21,0,"Yes, the auditor's report and notes to the financial statements for PC Jeweller Limited as of 31 March 2024 indicate delayed repayments to lenders, creditors, and suppliers. The report explicitly states that the company is contesting this classification in legal proceedings. There is evidence of delayed payments to lenders (Page 11) and creditors and suppliers (Page 105, Page 130, Page 178)."
2025-02-26 21:35:08,PCJEWELLER,2,22,0,"I could not make judgement, however content is : Yes, PC Jeweller Limited demonstrates a strong commitment to ethical practices and is clearly anti-corruption and anti-bribery, as evidenced in its policies extracted from the company website.

This explicitly outlines a zero-tolerance policy towards bribery and corruption and is further reinforced by other sections emphasizing honesty, integrity, and responsible conduct.  The commitment is not merely stated but is woven into various sections of the Code of Conduct, highlighting its importance to the company.

Yes, several policies from PC Jeweller Limited's website address ethics, core values, and ethical standards expected from employees and directors.

Specifically:

* **Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management:** This policy explicitly outlines the expected ethical behavior.  It emphasizes honesty, fairness, ethical conduct, integrity, responsibility, and accountability from directors and senior management.

It also addresses the use of confidential information acquired through their position in the Company, stating that it should not be used to benefit themselves or third parties. This section outlines the expected behavior with regards to dealings with third parties (customers, suppliers, etc).

**2. Code of Practices and Procedures for Fair Disclosure of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information:** This policy addresses communication with analysts and research personnel in relation to price sensitive information,  requiring that such information not be shared selectively with third parties. It further stresses the need for prompt and uniform public disclosure of price sensitive information to prevent selective disclosures to certain third parties.

In summary, PC Jeweller Limited demonstrates a strong emphasis on compliance with applicable laws and regulations across multiple facets of its operations, as evidenced by the explicit statements and implied adherence within its published policies.

Yes, the PC Jeweller Limited's **Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management**, found on their website, addresses the protection of company assets and information management.  Specifically, section 4.7 states:


""**4.7) USE OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTY / ASSETS & THEIR PROTECTION**

The property / assets of the Company shall be used for its business purposes and shall not be used
for personal gains by the Directors and Senior Management. Incidental personal use, if reasonable,
will not amount to violation of the Code. The Directors and Senior Management should also take
measures to protect the Company's property / assets.""


Additionally, section 4.3 of the same policy addresses confidentiality of information:


""**4.3) CONFIDENTIALITY**

The Directors and Senior Management shall not use, disclose or divulge to a third party, directly or
indirectly, any confidential information, acquired by them due to their position in the Company, for
their personal advantage or for the advantage of any other entity. Confidential information includes any
information relating to the Company's business, customers, suppliers etc., which is not available in
the public domain.""


Therefore, while not explicitly titled ""Asset and Information Management,"" these sections within the Code of Conduct demonstrate PC Jeweller's policies concerning the protection of company assets and the confidential handling of information.

Yes, the **Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management** from PC Jeweller Limited's website specifies disciplinary action for non-compliance with the code.  The relevant section (section 5) states:

""**DISCIPLINARY ACTION**

The Directors and Senior Management shall adhere to the Code. The Company will take appropriate disciplinary action for wilful or deliberate non-compliance, if any, of the Code.""

Yes, the **Business Responsibility Policy** from PC Jeweller Limited's website clearly states that the company has zero tolerance for bribery and corruption.

Any offer or grant of gift customary and / or are of a commemorative nature is not covered under the Policy.""


While the policy doesn't detail specific anti-bribery and anti-corruption measures beyond this statement of zero tolerance,  it does mention the implementation of policies like a Whistle Blower Policy and a Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management, which would likely contain further details on these measures.  The policy indicates a commitment to ethical conduct and transparency, which are fundamental components of an effective anti-corruption program.

Based on the provided text extracted from PC Jeweller Limited's website, there is no mention of the company being a signatory to any well-known global anti-corruption framework or code of ethical conduct.  While several policies (e.g., Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management, Business Responsibility Policy) address ethical conduct and compliance,  they do not explicitly state adherence to any specific global framework.
