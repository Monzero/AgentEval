2/26/25 2:09,PCJEWELLER,1,1,4,cg_report,"You are looking at the corporate governance report. Find the reappointment date for each board members. If the reppointment date is either not provided or older than 5 years (i.e some date before 2019), then you need to check appointment date. If appointment date is also older than 5 years (i.e before 2019), mark that board member as permanent. Give list of board members and whether or not they are permanent. In other words, either of appointment date or reappointment date should be within last 5 years. For example, if a board member has appoinment date '02-07-2020' and reappointment date is not present, then because the appointment date is within last 5 years  (i.e March 2020 to March 2025 assuming we are checking for annual report as of 31st March 2025) then we would label them as 'Not permanent'. Second example, if any board member has appointment date as 01-01-2012 and reappointment date not present, then we would mark them permanent. Do not present output in table format.

Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ","Here's an analysis of the board member permanency based on the provided corporate governance report (Page 2), considering the cutoff date of March 31st, 2024.

Balram Garg's reappointment date is 01-07-2021.  Since this date is within the last five years (before March 31st, 2024), he is not considered permanent.

Ramesh Kumar Sharma's reappointment date is 07-02-2022.  This date is also within the last five years, therefore he is not considered permanent.

Vishan Deo Farangi Lal's appointment date is 30-09-2024.  This date falls within the last five years, so he is not considered permanent.


Mahesh Agarwal's appointment date is 30-09-2024. As this date is within five years of March 31st 2024, he is not considered permanent.


Swathi Kansal's appointment date is 30-09-2024.  This falls within the last five years, making her not permanent.

Sannovanda Machaiah's appointment date is 19-01-2018.  This date is within the last five years from March 31st, 2024, therefore she is not considered a permanent member.Okay, I understand.  My apologies for the unclear request.

I'm interested in identifying board members of PC Jeweller Ltd. whose initial appointment or *most recent* reappointment to the board was before January 1, 2019.  The goal is to identify directors who have served on the board for an extended period, suggesting a degree of permanence or long-term commitment.  It's not about the total time served, just the date of their last appointment or reappointment.

Please re-examine the provided document and extract the names of those board members who meet this criteria (last appointment or reappointment before January 1, 2019).

My apologies; I misread the date on the notice. The provided document shows the AGM date as September 30, 2024, not August 6th.  The financial year end is March 31, 2024.

You are looking at the policies extracted from the company website. Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.,"Yes, PC Jeweller Limited has a policy addressing conflict of interest, specifically within its ""Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management,"" as found on the company website.  

Section 4.2, ""Conflict of Interest,"" states that Directors and Senior Management ""shall not engage in any business, activity or relationship, which may be in conflict with the interest of the Company.""  The policy mandates disclosure to the Board if such a situation arises.  It also prohibits the exploitation of corporate property, information, or position for personal gain without Board disclosure and approval.

However, the provided document does *not* explicitly detail policies regarding board cross-linkages or interlocking directorates.  While the Code of Conduct establishes a framework for ethical conduct, it does not address the specifics of potential conflicts arising from directors serving on multiple boards, potentially impacting related companies.  Therefore, based solely on the provided ""Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management"" document, the existence of a specific policy addressing board cross-linkages cannot be confirmed.

```This is a good summary of the related party transactions disclosed in the annual report.  However,  to make it more useful and insightful, consider these improvements:

**1.  Expand on the nature of the transactions:** The current summary only lists the amounts.  Adding a brief description of *what* these transactions represent would significantly improve clarity and context. For example:

* **Investments:**  Instead of just the amounts, specify if these are equity investments, loans, or other forms of investment.  The report may indicate the percentage of ownership held.
* **Remuneration:**  This should be clarified as salaries, bonuses, stock options, or other forms of compensation. Specifying if these are fixed or variable would also be helpful.
* **Loans:** Specify the interest rate and terms (maturity date, repayment schedule) of these loans.  Were they secured or unsecured?
* **Rent:**  Specify the property or properties involved.
* **Balance Outstanding:** This needs significantly more detail.  What is the nature of the outstanding balance?  Is it accrued interest, outstanding invoices, loans receivable?

**2.  Clearly delineate between subsidiaries, KMPs, and other related parties:** The report mixes amounts due from subsidiaries, KMPs, and the managing director.  Separate sections for these categories are crucial for better understanding.

**3.  Add a total amount:** Calculating the total value of all related party transactions would give a quick overview of their materiality to the company's overall financials.

**4. Compliance with Regulations:** Briefly mention whether the disclosures are in accordance with applicable accounting standards and regulations (like Ind AS 24).  The report likely references this compliance.


**Example of Improved Summary:**

**Related Party Transactions for the Year Ended March 31, 2024**

This summary details related party transactions as disclosed in the company's annual report. Note that it may not be exhaustive and may not represent the most up-to-date information.

**I. Transactions with Subsidiaries:**

These figures represent equity investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries (unless otherwise stated).  The company should disclose percentage ownership in each.

* **Luxury Products Trendsetter Private Limited:** ₹0.01 equity investment.
* **PC Jeweller Global DMCC:** ₹133.86 equity investment.
* **PC Universal Private Limited:** ₹0.05 equity investment (ceased to be a subsidiary during the year).
* **PCJ Gems & Jewellery Limited:** ₹0.05 equity investment.
* **Transforming Retail Private Limited:** ₹0.01 equity investment (ceased to be a subsidiary in a prior year).


**II. Transactions with Key Management Personnel (KMP) and Directors:**

* **Remuneration:** This section should detail salary, bonuses, and other compensation for each individual, specifying whether these figures include fixed and variable components.
    * Mr. Balram Garg (Managing Director):  [Insert amount] Total Compensation. (Break down into salary, bonus, etc.)
    * Mr. Sanjeev Bhatia (CFO): [Insert amount] Total Compensation. (Break down into salary, bonus, etc.)
    * Mr. Vijay Panwar (Company Secretary): [Insert amount] Total Compensation. (Break down into salary, bonus, etc.)
    * Mr. Ramesh Kumar Sharma (Executive Director): [Insert amount] Total Compensation. (Break down into salary, bonus, etc.)


**III. Other Related Party Transactions:**

* **Rent paid to Mr. Balram Garg:** ₹0.01 for [Specify Property].
* **Outstanding Balances:**  A detailed explanation of the nature of each outstanding balance is needed.  (e.g., ""Accrued interest on loans to Mr. Balram Garg: ₹X"")


**IV. Total Related Party Transactions:**  ₹ [Insert Total Amount]


**V. Regulatory Compliance:**  Disclosures appear to be in accordance with Ind AS 24, but this should be verified against the full report.


By providing this level of detail, the summary becomes a much more valuable tool for analyzing the company's financial statements and governance practices. Remember to replace bracketed information with actual figures from the report.

**Indirect References to Supplier Relations:**

* **Business Responsibility Policy:** This policy mentions the Company's commitment to ethical conduct and fair dealing with stakeholders which implicitly includes suppliers. The policy emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and responsible resource management which could impact supplier selection criteria. However, no explicit supplier selection or management details are given.  (Source: PC Jeweller Limited's Business Responsibility Policy)


**Verdict:**

While PC Jeweller Limited's Business Responsibility Policy touches upon ethical business practices that would indirectly impact supplier relationships, there is no dedicated policy detailing specific standards and procedures for supplier/vendor selection and management within the provided document set.  Therefore, the evidence suggests that while the company acknowledges the importance of ethical conduct in its dealings, it does not explicitly outline its supplier/vendor selection or management practices in any of the included policies.

The report explicitly states that the company is contesting this classification in legal proceedings.

* **Page 12:** State Bank of India (SBI) moved the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Delhi (DRT), for recovery of dues.  The company responded with appeals which are sub-judice.  The situation is further complicated by actions from other banks including the Union Bank of India.

* **Page 104:** A table details the period and amount of default in loan repayments at year-end. Multiple lenders are listed with varying degrees of overdue amounts ranging from 1 to 1095 days.  The company disputes several of these amounts.


**Creditors and Suppliers:**

* **Page 105:** There is mention of outstanding dues to creditors,  specifically trade payables, categorized by micro enterprises and small enterprises versus other creditors.  Amounts are also indicated for disputed debts.

* **Page 130:**  Principal amounts and interest due remain unpaid to suppliers.  The company makes certain justifications relating to the MSMED Act 2006.

* **Page 178:**  Details of delayed payments are further clarified for various types of creditors and the justifications the company provided are detailed.

**Qualified Opinion:**

The auditors issued a qualified opinion because of three material uncertainties related to:

1.  **Discounts to export customers (Note 51):** The company provided significant discounts to export customers in the financial year 2019, and the auditors were unable to fully verify the accounting treatment of the remaining discounts due to missing approvals and supporting documents.  (page 75)

2.  **Provision for expected credit loss on overdue overseas receivables (Note 52):**  Significant overdue receivables existed, and the auditors couldn't fully verify the adequacy of the provision for impairment due to uncertainties about recovery. (page 75)

3.  **Inventory valuation (Note 52):** The company's inventory was held under court custody, preventing physical verification by the auditors and the management. The auditors relied on management's valuation, resulting in an inability to fully examine the inventory value. (page 76)


**Management's Comments on Qualified Opinion:**

The management provides detailed explanations for each of the three issues in the notes to the standalone financial statements (pages 140-142, 140-142, and 140-142). Management addresses each point and justifies the accounting treatments they have followed.

**Emphasis of Matter:**

The auditors highlight two specific matters requiring attention (page 76):

1.  **Delay in receipt of foreign currency proceeds (Note 52):** The company encountered delays in receiving export payments in foreign currency. The auditors note that the management has applied for condonation of these delays, but as the potential penalties were unascertainable, no adjustments were made.
2.  **Deferred Tax Assets (Note 8):** Because of recurring losses, the company did not recognize deferred tax assets.


**Management's Comments on Emphasis of Matter:**

The management addresses these items in the notes to the standalone financial statements (pages 140-142, and 140-142), providing explanations for the delay in foreign currency receipts and the absence of deferred tax assets.


**Auditor Resignation:**

The annual report does mention that M/s Arun K. Agarwal & Associates resigned as statutory auditors on 14 August 2023 (page 15) but does *not* state the reason for resignation.  It simply states that the resignation was based on ""economic viability"", suggesting financial reasons rather than differences of opinion or suspicious reasons.

**Qualified Opinion:** Yes, the independent auditor, M/s Arun K. Agarwal & Associates, issued a qualified opinion.  (Page 67, Standalone Financial Statements)

The basis for the qualified opinion centers around three key issues:

1. **Discounts to Export Customers (Page 67):**  The company gave significant discounts (₹513.65 crore) to export customers in FY19. While approvals for some of these discounts were obtained subsequently, approvals for the remaining ₹183.16 crore were pending.  The auditors couldn't assess the impact of these unapproved discounts on the standalone financial statements.

2. **Provision for Expected Credit Loss/Impairment (Page 67):**  Significant overdue overseas trade receivables existed. Although the company made provisions, the auditors couldn't determine if this was adequate, given the lack of realization and pending legal action related to debt recovery.

3. **Inventory Valuation (Page 67-68):**  Due to legal action involving the seizure of inventory, a physical verification couldn't be performed by the company at various locations by the audit deadline.  The auditors therefore could not validate the inventory value.

**Management's Response to Qualified Opinion:** The management provides detailed explanations for each point under the section  ""Management Discussion & Analysis""  (pages 62-66) clarifying their position and actions taken to address the auditor’s concerns.  

**Emphasis of Matter:** Yes, there are two items emphasized by the auditor (page 68).

1. **Delays in Receipt of Foreign Currency Proceeds (Page 68):**  Significant delays in receiving payments for overseas exports occurred, potentially breaching the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.  Management explained they applied for condonation of the delay.

2. **Impairment Assessment of Subsidiaries (Page 68):**  The management performed an impairment assessment of its subsidiaries using the Discounted Cash Flow model.  While they recognized an additional provision, it was a complex calculation with inherent estimation uncertainty.

**Auditor Resignation:** The annual report does *not* indicate that the auditor resigned due to a difference of opinion or any suspicious reason.  While there is a mention of M/s Arun K. Agarwal & Associates resigning as Statutory Auditors on page 207, no reason was given in this context.  However, the report does state that the Board approved the appointment of a new auditor (AHPN) following their resignation.

**Important Note:**  Always refer to the full text of the auditor's report and the management discussion and analysis for a comprehensive understanding. This analysis provides a summary for ease of comprehension.

This information is found on pages 53-55 of the annual report.

**Qualified Opinion:**

The auditor's report states that their opinion is qualified due to:

1.  **Discounts to export customers:**  The company provided significant discounts to export customers in a prior year, which were adjusted against revenues for that year.  The auditors were unable to verify the impact, if any, because of the lack of requisite approvals and supporting documentation.  (Page 55)


2.  **Delays in receiving foreign currency proceeds:** Delays were incurred in receiving payments denominated in foreign currency from overseas customers. The auditors expressed uncertainty regarding the possible material impact of any penalties that may be levied for these delays. (Page 55)


3. **Impairment Assessment:** The management's complex impairment assessment of investments and receivables  using the 'Discounted Cash Flow Valuation Model' caused the auditor to express a qualified opinion (page 55).

**Emphasis of Matter:**

The auditor's report also emphasizes the following matters:

1.  Further details on the discounts provided to export customers in 2019. (Page 55)
2.  The uncertainties and management's assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial statements. (Page 55)

The provided report does not list the exact appointment date for all committee members.

To answer this question completely, you'll need to check the individual director's appointment dates from another source or earlier annual reports.
That's a much improved question.  The original was too broad.  The rephrased question is specific and actionable.  I would only suggest one small edit to make it even better:

""Can you please provide me with the list of members of the Audit Committee and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) as of March 31, 2024?  Please include their appointment dates.  Finally, does any member of either committee have a tenure exceeding 10 years?""

Then calculate the ratio R2 = CEO compensation/ net profit.  You are looking at the annual report as of 31st March 2024. Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ,"Here's the information you requested from PC Jeweller Limited's Annual Report for the year ended 31st March 2024:


**CEO Compensation:**

The annual report does not explicitly state the CEO's compensation separately.  Instead, it provides the remuneration for the Managing Director, which is likely the same individual.  The Managing Director's remuneration for the year ended March 31, 2024 was **₹14.35 crore**. (Page 11, Annual Report 2023-24)

**Net Profit:**

The standalone net loss (net profit is negative) for the company for the year ended March 31, 2024 was **₹(649.27) crore**. (Page 10, Annual Report 2023-24)

**Ratio Calculation (R2):**

Given the net *loss* rather than profit, a direct ratio calculation isn't meaningful.  To illustrate the relative proportion of the Managing Director's remuneration compared to the loss, we can calculate the ratio as follows:


R2 = |Managing Director Compensation| / |Net Loss| =  14.35 crore / 649.27 crore = 0.022

This indicates that the Managing Director's remuneration represents approximately 2.2% of the absolute value of the net loss.  Again, this is not a standard profitability ratio due to the negative net profit.

Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ","The provided annual report for PC Jeweller Limited as of 31st March 2024 does not provide a breakdown of the CEO's compensation into long-term and short-term components.  Therefore, the ratio R1 cannot be calculated.  The relevant information regarding CEO compensation is on page 11.
You're right, the provided annual report doesn't explicitly break down the CEO's compensation into a precise ratio of long-term incentives versus short-term bonuses (R1).  Therefore, calculating R1 directly isn't possible from this document.

However, we can explore the suggested alternative metrics to gain insight into the CEO's compensation structure:


**1. Ratio of Stock-Based Compensation to Total Compensation:**

The report does not provide information on stock-based compensation for the CEO.  This metric therefore cannot be calculated.


**2. Proportion of Performance-Based Bonuses versus Fixed Salaries:**

The report doesn't explicitly state the CEO's compensation as a separate line item with a breakdown of fixed salary and performance-based bonuses.  We cannot calculate this ratio.


**3. Duration of Vesting Periods for Equity Awards:**

The report mentions the CEO received no bonus or stock options.  Therefore, there are no equity awards with vesting periods to analyze.


**Overall Conclusion:**

The provided 2024 annual report lacks the detailed breakdown of the CEO's compensation needed to calculate the requested ratio (R1) or to effectively utilize the suggested alternative metrics.  More information directly from the company would be needed to answer this question comprehensively.
