2025-03-07 22:06:14,PCJEWELLER,1,4,0,"Although the report does not explicitly list board members or executives' involvement with lenders, it suggests that there may be significant interaction and possibly inter-connectedness between the company's leadership and financial institutions. However, no explicit mention of any board member belonging to a lender group is found in the document. Since it does not provide direct information about the permanent status of directors being representatives of lenders, I score this as 0."
2025-03-07 22:06:22,PCJEWELLER,1,7,0,"The gap between the FYE (March 31, 2024) and the AGM (September 30, 2023) is 6 months, which exceeds the threshold of 4-6 months. According to the scoring criteria, a score of 0 is assigned when the gap is more than 6 months. No further information or calculation is required as the provided dates clearly indicate that the AGM was held before the end of the financial year."
2025-03-07 22:06:35,PCJEWELLER,1,10,2,"PC Jeweller Limited has a policy addressing conflict of interest with stakeholders, which covers all stakeholders including suppliers and vendors (Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management, section 4.2). The policy does not explicitly address board cross-linkages as a specific type of conflict of interest, but the broad language suggests that any situation where a director or senior management member's personal interests or relationships with other entities could conflict with the company's interests would fall under this section and require proper disclosure to the board. Additionally, there is no instance found in the provided text or report (Corporate Governance report for PC Jeweller LTD. as of December 31st, 2024) that suggests a conflict of interest with stakeholders."
2025-03-07 22:06:43,PCJEWELLER,1,12,2,"Since the total amount of royalty transactions is 0, it is not possible to calculate a ratio with the company's profit (which was also not provided). However, since the only relevant information available is the net loss, and 0 is less than the net loss of â‚¹629.36 crore, we can conclude that the ratio would be less than 0.1. Therefore, according to the scoring criteria, a score of 2 is justified."
2025-03-07 22:06:50,PCJEWELLER,1,16,2,"Based on the provided Annual Report of PC Jeweller Limited as of 31st March 2024, there is no explicit description of pyramidal holding structures or complicated cross-entity structures that could disproportionately increase the voting power of promoters. The report does not provide sufficient information to determine with certainty who the ultimate beneficial owner(s) are, but this lack of transparency regarding ultimate beneficial ownership does not necessarily suggest a structure that could violate minority stakeholders' rights. Therefore, based solely on the provided document, there is no evidence to suggest that the company uses structures or mechanisms that could violate minority stakeholders' rights."
2025-03-07 22:07:00,PCJEWELLER,2,18,2,"PC Jeweller Limited has publicly disclosed its health, safety, and welfare policies, and the company provides information on the number of employee accidents and labor fatalities.

Additionally, the Annual Report 2023-24 (page 131) reports no fatalities or high consequence work-related injuries/ill-health for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. The company's commitment to providing a safe and healthy working environment is also evident through its policies and initiatives, such as training on health, safety, and sexual harassment."
2025-03-07 22:07:12,PCJEWELLER,2,19,1,"The company has publicly disclosed its policy regarding sexual harassment through its Whistle Blower Policy, which outlines a mechanism for reporting and investigating complaints of 'unethical behaviour, actual or suspected fraud, violation of the Codes/Policies of the Company.' Although the specific name of the policy is not mentioned, the policy itself addresses sexual harassment. Additionally, the PC Jeweller Limited Annual Report (as of 31st March 2024) states that the company has a policy against sexual harassment and mentions the existence of an Internal Complaints Committee for addressing such complaints. Although no complaints were received during the year under review, the report does provide some information on the company's policy and procedures regarding sexual harassment. Reference: PC Jeweller Limited Annual Report (as of 31st March 2024), Page 13."
2025-03-07 22:07:19,PCJEWELLER,2,20,1,"Although there is no dedicated policy for supplier/vendor selection or management, the Business Responsibility Policy hints at some considerations influencing supplier interactions regarding sustainability and ethical conduct. While detailed selection criteria and management protocols are not available, it implies that suppliers may be expected to meet certain standards relating to sustainability and ethical sourcing.

2025-03-07 22:07:30,PCJEWELLER,2,21,0,"Based on the provided Annual Report of PC Jeweller Limited as of various dates (March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023), it is clear that the company has delayed payments to its lenders. The auditor's report notes this on page 13 in the 2024 report and page 56 in the 2022 report. Additionally, Note 19 in both reports details significant overdue amounts to various banks, highlighting the status of the company's accounts as Non-Performing Assets (NPA). Furthermore, Note 50 in the 2024 report discusses ongoing legal actions with lenders, mentioning the company's efforts to resolve the issue via a One Time Settlement (OTS) and the subsequent withdrawal of an insolvency petition by SBI. These indications suggest that PC Jeweller Limited has delayed payments to its lenders."
