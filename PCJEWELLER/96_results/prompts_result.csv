If the reppointment date is either not provided or older than 5 years (i.e some date before 2019), then you need to check appointment date. If appointment date is also older than 5 years (i.e before 2019), mark that board member as permanent. Give list of board members and whether or not they are permanent. In other words, either of appointment date or reappointment date should be within last 5 years. For example, if a board member has appoinment date '02-07-2020' and reappointment date is not present, then because the appointment date is within last 5 years  (i.e March 2020 to March 2025 assuming we are checking for annual report as of 31st March 2025) then we would label them as 'Not permanent'. Second example, if any board member has appointment date as 01-01-2012 and reappointment date not present, then we would mark them permanent. Do not present output in table format.

The 5-year threshold is calculated from March 31st, 2019.

Balram Garg's reappointment date is 01-07-2021, which falls within the 5-year timeframe. Therefore, he is not considered permanent.

Ramesh Kumar Sharma's reappointment date is 07-02-2022, which falls within the 5-year timeframe. Therefore, he is not considered permanent.


Vishan Deo Farangi Lal's appointment date is 30-09-2024, which falls within the 5-year timeframe. Therefore, he is not considered permanent.

Mahesh Agarwal's appointment date is 30-09-2024, which falls within the 5-year timeframe. Therefore, he is not considered permanent.

You are looking at the annual report as of 31st March 2024. Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ","I have reviewed the provided annual report of PC Jeweller Limited as of March 31, 2024.  There is no explicit mention of any board member belonging to a lender group within the document.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
The provided annual report does not explicitly list board members or executives' involvement with lenders or financial institutions holding a stake in the company's debt or success.  However, the report strongly suggests the existence of such relationships, though the details aren't fully transparent.

The report repeatedly mentions extensive legal battles with lenders,  negotiations for a One Time Settlement (OTS) with multiple lenders, and the withdrawal of an insolvency petition by a major lender (SBI) after partial OTS acceptance.  The detailed description of these events implies significant interaction and possibly inter-connectedness between the company's leadership and these financial institutions.

To answer definitively whether board members or executives have *direct* involvement with the lender groups requires access to information beyond the scope of this annual report.  The report's language strongly hints at such connections but doesn't provide the explicit details requested.
That's a good, clear query.  There's no need to change it.  It politely and directly asks for the information needed while also offering an alternative answer if the information isn't present.

Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information ","Here's the answer to your question.

**FYE:** The last financial year ended on **March 31, 2024**. This information is available on page 10 of the annual report.

**AGM:** The last Annual General Meeting (AGM) was scheduled for **September 30, 2023**. This is mentioned on page 217 of the annual report.  Note that an earlier AGM date (September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022) were also available on the same page. However, these dates are before the FYE date of 31 March 2024, so they were ignored as per the instructions.

**Gap:** The gap between the FYE (March 31, 2024) and the AGM (September 30, 2023) is **6 months**.
Based on the provided document, here's the answer to your query:

* **Financial Year End (FYE) date:** March 31st, 2024.  This is explicitly stated throughout the document.

* **Date of the last AGM:** September 30th, 2023. This is found in the ""Notice"" section of the annual report.

* **Gap between FYE and AGM:**  There is a gap of 6 months between the FYE (March 31st, 2024) and the AGM (September 30th, 2023).  The AGM was held *before* the end of the financial year.


**If you need this information for a *future* annual report (beyond March 31st, 2024), you would need to:**

1. **Check the company's investor relations website:** Most publicly listed companies post their annual reports and AGM notices online shortly after the events occur. Look for a section labeled ""Investor Relations,"" ""Financial Reports,"" or something similar.

2. **Subscribe to company news releases:**  Companies often announce these dates through press releases.  You might need to register on their website to receive email alerts.

3. **Use a financial data provider:** Services such as Bloomberg, Refinitiv, or FactSet provide up-to-date financial information, including annual report dates and AGM schedules, for publicly traded companies.

**Calculation of the Gap:**

The gap between the FYE (March 31, 2024) and the last AGM (September 30, 2023) is approximately **183 days**.  This is calculated considering a 31-day month on average.  A more precise calculation could be made, but this gives a reasonable approximation."
2025-03-06 21:11:53,5,1,10,combined_policies,Does the company have policy regarding conflict of interest with stakeholders? Does it cover board cross linkages? You are looking at the policies extracted from the company website. Make sure you quote this source in your answer along with the relevant policy name.,"Yes, PC Jeweller Limited has a policy addressing conflict of interest with stakeholders.  This is covered in their ""Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management,"" which was obtained from their website.

Specifically, section 4.2, ""Conflict of Interest,"" states:

""The Directors and Senior Management shall not engage in any business, activity or relationship, which may be in conflict with the interest of the Company. If such a situation arises then the Directors and Senior Management shall act in the best interest of the Company with proper disclosure to the Board.""

The policy doesn't explicitly address board cross-linkages as a specific type of conflict of interest. However, the broad language of the policy suggests that any situation where a director or senior management member's personal interests or relationships with other entities could conflict with the company's interests would fall under the purview of this section and require proper disclosure to the board.  Therefore, while not explicitly stated, board cross-linkages would likely be covered under the broader conflict of interest clause.

Therefore, it does *not* contain information for March 31st, 2024.  The report only covers the quarter ending December 2024.  To answer your question about the Nomination and Remuneration Committee's composition as of March 31st, 2024, you will need a different corporate governance report covering that specific period.
I cannot directly access and process external documents or specific files online, including the PC Jeweller LTD. corporate governance report you mentioned.  Therefore, I cannot provide you with the page number containing the information about the composition of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee as of December 31st, 2024.

To find this information, you will need to manually review the report. Look for a section titled ""Nomination and Remuneration Committee,"" ""Board Committees,"" or something similar.  Within that section, there should be a list of committee members with their designations (Executive Director, Non-Executive Director, Independent Director).  Page numbers are usually present in the document's header or footer.

That's a much better question!  The provided text is for the quarter ending December 2024, not March 31st, 2024.  However, looking at the December 2024 report,  the Audit Committee composition shows:

* **Balram Garg:** Executive Director.  He is listed as a member.

Therefore, the answer to the *rephrased* question, adjusted for the available data, is **yes**.

Look for a section on ""Corporate Governance,"" ""Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report,"" or ""Statutory Reports.""  These sections often contain details about policies and procedures related to workplace conduct, including sexual harassment.

2. **Review the relevant sections:** Look for details on the company's policy, complaint mechanisms, any reported incidents, and how those incidents were handled.  Pay close attention to the language used; sometimes, the information may be presented indirectly.

3. **Contact the company directly:** If you can't find the information in the annual report, you can contact PC Jeweller Limited's investor relations department or their compliance officer.  They may be able to provide further details.

 Look at the content and find the policy name where is it written about this. Do not make up information.

Finally sumarize your verdict whether the company has policies for supplier/vendor selection as well as supplier/vendor management. You are looking at the policies extracted from the company website.

Therefore, a direct answer to whether they have such policies in place cannot be definitively provided from this source.

However, some information related to supplier interactions can be gleaned from different policies:

**Hints about Supplier Interactions (No dedicated policy):**

* **Business Responsibility Policy:** This policy mentions the company's commitment to sustainable development and fulfilling social, environmental and economic responsibilities.  While not explicitly detailing supplier selection, it implies a consideration of ethical and sustainable practices which might indirectly influence supplier choices.  The policy states that the company strives to minimize waste and recycle resources, and that its jewellery complies with all applicable standards. These points suggest that suppliers may be expected to meet certain standards relating to sustainability and ethical sourcing.


**Verdict:**

Based solely on the provided documents from PC Jeweller Limited's website, there is no evidence of a dedicated policy explicitly outlining supplier/vendor selection *criteria* or a comprehensive supplier/vendor *management* policy. While the Business Responsibility Policy hints at some considerations influencing supplier interactions regarding sustainability and ethical conduct,  detailed selection criteria and management protocols are not available in the provided text.
That's an excellent revised query.  It's much more likely to elicit useful information than a query that assumes the existence of specific, publicly available documents.  The open-ended nature allows for a broader range of responses, including:

* **General descriptions of their vendor selection process:**  This could include criteria like financial stability, quality control, ethical sourcing, and environmental standards, even if not formally codified in a published policy.
* **Mention of internal guidelines or codes of conduct:**  Even if not publicly accessible, the response might acknowledge the existence of internal documents that guide supplier relationships.
* **Links to relevant sections of their annual report or sustainability reports:** These reports sometimes contain high-level information about supply chain management.
* **An explanation of why they don't publicly disclose such policies:** This could be due to competitive reasons or the nature of their internal processes.
* **A contact for further inquiries:**  The response may direct you to a specific department or individual who can provide more detailed information.

The revised query is a significant improvement because it focuses on obtaining information *about* their practices, rather than simply locating specific documents.  This approach is far more pragmatic when dealing with companies that may not publicly share all of their internal policies.

The report indicates that these were largely due to ongoing legal disputes and resulting liquidity issues.

Here's a breakdown based on the provided documents:

**Lenders:**

* **Page 11:** The report states that lenders classified the company's accounts as Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) due to default/non-payment of debt/interest.  The company disputes this classification and has taken legal action.  The lenders also initiated legal proceedings for debt recovery.
* **Page 12:** The company mentions further legal action by State Bank of India (SBI) and other lenders in Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) for recovery of dues. The matter is sub-judice.


**Creditors:**

* **Page 15:** The independent auditor's report notes that the company had outstanding trade receivables (amounts owed by customers) of over ₹1,707 crores as of March 31, 2023, a portion of which is overdue.  The auditor indicates uncertainty regarding the recoverability of these receivables.

**Suppliers:**

* **Page 130:** The notes to the financial statements, specifically note 43, details the principal amount and interest due to suppliers which remains unpaid.  The amount listed is ₹1.85 crore as of March 31, 2023. The company attributes this to delays in payments to small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).


It's important to note that the company's financial statements contain multiple references to legal disputes with lenders impacting their ability to make timely payments.  The exact amounts and specific timelines of all delayed payments are not fully clarified due to the ongoing legal proceedings and the complexities involved.

**Lenders:**

The auditor's report (page 56) notes that as of March 31, 2022, the company had overdue amounts to various lenders ranging between 1 and 730 days.  The report further explains this was due to the company’s accounts turning into non-performing assets (NPAs).   A resolution proposal with the lenders was under active consideration at the time of the report.  More detail on the overdue amounts is provided in Note 19 (page 87) of the standalone financial statements.

**Suppliers:**

Note 43 (page 114) of the standalone financial statements reveals that, as of March 31, 2022, there were overdue principal and interest payments to suppliers of  ₹0.16 crore and ₹0.29 crore, respectively.  The note makes it clear that the overdue amount is defined under the MSMED Act, 2006.
