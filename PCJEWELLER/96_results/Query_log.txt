 Here is what Gemini got :  Here's an analysis of the board member's permanency status based on the provided corporate governance report (Page 2), considering the report's date as March 31st, 2024.  The 5-year threshold is calculated from March 31st, 2019.

Balram Garg's reappointment date is 01-07-2021, which falls within the 5-year timeframe. Therefore, he is not considered permanent.

Ramesh Kumar Sharma's reappointment date is 07-02-2022, which falls within the 5-year timeframe. Therefore, he is not considered permanent.


Vishan Deo Farangi Lal's appointment date is 30-09-2024, which falls within the 5-year timeframe. Therefore, he is not considered permanent.

Mahesh Agarwal's appointment date is 30-09-2024, which falls within the 5-year timeframe. Therefore, he is not considered permanent.

Swathi Kansal's appointment date is 30-09-2024, which falls within the 5-year timeframe. Therefore, she is not considered permanent.

Sannovanda Machaiah's appointment date is 19-01-2018 which falls within the last 5 years. Therefore, she is not considered permanent.

Guardrail response :  Here is the evaluation of the LLM's output:

**Got Answer:** No
**Source Mentioned:** Yes

Reasoning: The LLM's answer does not meet the requirements of the question. The question asks for a list of board members with their permanency status, but the LLM only provides individual analysis for each member.

The correct approach would be to provide a list of board members with their permanency status, along with the source (i.e., page number) from which the information was extracted.

For example:
{
"got_answer": "no",
"source_mentioned": "yes"
}

Here is what a correct answer might look like:

{
"board_members": [
{"name": "Balram Garg", "permanency_status": "Not Permanent"},
{"name": "Ramesh Kumar Sharma", "permanency_status": "Not Permanent"},
{"name": "Vishan Deo Farangi Lal", "permanency_status": "Not Permanent"},
{"name": "Mahesh Agarwal", "permanency_status": "Not Permanent"},
{"name": "Swathi Kansal", "permanency_status": "Not Permanent"},
{"name": "Sannovanda Machaiah", "permanency_status": "Permanent"}
],
"source": "Corporate Governance Report (Page 2)"
}

Note that Sannovanda Machaiah's appointment date is older than 5 years, so she would be marked as permanent.

Guardrail response :  Here is my assessment:

**Did LLM get the answer?**: No
**Does the answer do justice to the question?**: Yes, the LLM correctly responded that there is no explicit mention of any board member belonging to a lender group within the document.
**Does the answer mention the page number or section number from which it has got the answer?**: No

So, I would rate this answer as follows:

{"got_answer": "no", 
"source_mentioned": "no"}

This is because the LLM did not provide a specific source reference (page number or section number) to support its answer. To make the answer more reliable, it should have mentioned the source from which it extracted the information.

We are using following modified query  It seems that I was unable to find the information requested despite searching the annual report as of 31st March 2024. This is likely because the information may not be explicitly stated in the report.

To rephrase the question, we could ask:

"Are any board members or executives involved with lenders or financial institutions that have a stake in the company's success or debt obligations? If so, what are their specific roles and relationships?"

This revised query aims to uncover potential connections between board members or executives and lender groups, which may not be explicitly stated in the annual report.

Saving following answer :  I have reviewed the provided annual report of PC Jeweller Limited as of March 31, 2024.  There is no explicit mention of any board member belonging to a lender group within the document.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
The provided annual report does not explicitly list board members or executives' involvement with lenders or financial institutions holding a stake in the company's debt or success.  However, the report strongly suggests the existence of such relationships, though the details aren't fully transparent.

The report repeatedly mentions extensive legal battles with lenders,  negotiations for a One Time Settlement (OTS) with multiple lenders, and the withdrawal of an insolvency petition by a major lender (SBI) after partial OTS acceptance.  The detailed description of these events implies significant interaction and possibly inter-connectedness between the company's leadership and these financial institutions.

To answer definitively whether board members or executives have *direct* involvement with the lender groups requires access to information beyond the scope of this annual report.  The report's language strongly hints at such connections but doesn't provide the explicit details requested.
That's a good, clear query.  There's no need to change it.  It politely and directly asks for the information needed while also offering an alternative answer if the information isn't present.

**JSON Format:**
{
"got_answer": "no",

Reasoning:
The LLM provided answers for FYE and AGM, but they are incorrect.

* The last financial year ended on March 31, 2024, which is not accurate because the annual report as of 31st March 2024 would have mentioned the FYE date for a previous year.
* The last Annual General Meeting (AGM) was scheduled for September 30, 2023, which is also incorrect because it should be after the FYE date.

The LLM did mention the page number from which they extracted the information ("page 10" and "page 217"), but the answers themselves are not accurate. Therefore, the answer does not do justice to the question.

Saving following answer :  Here's the answer to your question.

**FYE:** The last financial year ended on **March 31, 2024**. This information is available on page 10 of the annual report.

**Gap:** The gap between the FYE (March 31, 2024) and the AGM (September 30, 2023) is **6 months**.
Based on the provided document, here's the answer to your query:

* **Financial Year End (FYE) date:** March 31st, 2024.  This is explicitly stated throughout the document.

* **Date of the last AGM:** September 30th, 2023. This is found in the "Notice" section of the annual report.

* **Gap between FYE and AGM:**  There is a gap of 6 months between the FYE (March 31st, 2024) and the AGM (September 30th, 2023).  The AGM was held *before* the end of the financial year.


**If you need this information for a *future* annual report (beyond March 31st, 2024), you would need to:**

1. **Check the company's investor relations website:** Most publicly listed companies post their annual reports and AGM notices online shortly after the events occur. Look for a section labeled "Investor Relations," "Financial Reports," or something similar.

2. **Subscribe to company news releases:**  Companies often announce these dates through press releases.  You might need to register on their website to receive email alerts.

3. **Use a financial data provider:** Services such as Bloomberg, Refinitiv, or FactSet provide up-to-date financial information, including annual report dates and AGM schedules, for publicly traded companies.

 Here is what Gemini got :  Here's the information extracted from the provided annual report (as of 31 March 2024):

* **FYE (Financial Year End):** March 31, 2024 (Page 7, 10)

**Calculation of the Gap:**

The gap between the FYE (March 31, 2024) and the last AGM (September 30, 2023) is approximately **183 days**.  This is calculated considering a 31-day month on average.  A more precise calculation could be made, but this gives a reasonable approximation.

Guardrail response :  Here is the assessment of the LLM's output:

{

The LLM did get the answer to the question, which was about the last financial year end (FYE) and the last Annual General Meeting (AGM) scheduled. The FYE is indeed mentioned as March 31, 2024, on page 7 or 10 of the annual report. Similarly, the AGM date is mentioned as September 30, 2023, on pages 52 and 217.

The answer also calculates the gap between these two dates, which is approximately 183 days. The calculation assumes an average month has 31 days, but notes that a more precise calculation could be made for greater accuracy.

Overall, the LLM's output does justice to the question, providing the relevant information and supporting it with page numbers from the annual report.

Okay, asking Gemini...

 Here is what Gemini got :  Yes, PC Jeweller Limited has a policy addressing conflict of interest with stakeholders.  This is covered in their "Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management," which was obtained from their website.

Specifically, section 4.2, "Conflict of Interest," states:

"The Directors and Senior Management shall not engage in any business, activity or relationship, which may be in conflict with the interest of the Company. If such a situation arises then the Directors and Senior Management shall act in the best interest of the Company with proper disclosure to the Board."

The policy doesn't explicitly address board cross-linkages as a specific type of conflict of interest. However, the broad language of the policy suggests that any situation where a director or senior management member's personal interests or relationships with other entities could conflict with the company's interests would fall under the purview of this section and require proper disclosure to the board.  Therefore, while not explicitly stated, board cross-linkages would likely be covered under the broader conflict of interest clause.

Guardrail response :  Here is my assessment of the LLM's answer:

The LLM did get the answer, and it mentioned the source ("Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management") from which it obtained the information. Additionally, the LLM provided specific section numbers (4.2) and quotes relevant policy language to support its answer.

However, while the LLM's answer is generally accurate, there are some minor improvements that could be made to make it even more reliable. For example:

* The answer could specify the exact webpage or URL from which the information was obtained, rather than simply mentioning a "website" as the source.
* The language used in the policy quote could be rephrased for clarity and concision.

Overall, though, I would give the LLM's answer a strong score of 4.5/5.

To answer your question about the Nomination and Remuneration Committee's composition as of March 31st, 2024, you will need a different corporate governance report covering that specific period.

Therefore, I cannot provide you with the page number containing the information about the composition of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee as of December 31st, 2024.

To find this information, you will need to manually review the report. Look for a section titled "Nomination and Remuneration Committee," "Board Committees," or something similar.  Within that section, there should be a list of committee members with their designations (Executive Director, Non-Executive Director, Independent Director).  Page numbers are usually present in the document's header or footer.

Therefore, the answer to the *rephrased* question, adjusted for the available data, is **yes**.  There is at least one non-independent director (Balram Garg, an executive director) serving on the Audit Committee as of December 31st, 2024.

Saving following answer :  Based on my analysis of the provided PC Jeweller Limited Annual Report (as of 31 March 2024), there is no explicit mention of direct linkages between key management personnel or board members and key suppliers or vendors.  The report does include a section on related party transactions (Note 37, pages 119-126), but this section does not reveal any such relationships.  The related party disclosures focus on financial transactions and relationships with subsidiaries, but do not list suppliers or vendors among the related parties.

Okay, asking Gemini...

 Here is what Gemini got :  Based on the provided annual report (PC Jeweller Limited, Annual Report 2023-24), there is no information regarding linkages between key management personnel or board members and competitors.  The report does not disclose any such relationships as of March 31st, 2024.  Therefore, I cannot provide a page number referencing such a linkage as it does not exist in this document.

Guardrail response :  Here is my assessment of the LLM's answer:

{"got_answer": "yes", "source_mentioned": "yes"}

The LLM's answer correctly states that there is no information regarding linkages between key management personnel or board members and competitors in the annual report. This answers the question accurately.

The LLM also mentions the source ("PC Jeweller Limited, Annual Report 2023-24") which meets the requirement of referencing the annual report.

However, I would like to see a specific page number or section mentioned in the answer to make it more reliable and accurate. The current answer is still valid, but could be improved by including the relevant page number or section information.

Overall, the LLM's answer gets 7/10 for its accuracy and reliability.

The LLM answered the question correctly by stating that the company made a net loss of ₹629.36 crore, but it failed to provide a profit answer as the question asked for profits, not losses.

However, the LLM did mention the source (annual report) and the page number (158) where it found the information, which is good practice for providing reliable answers.

To rephrase your original query, I would suggest:

"Can you please guide me on how to extract the profit information from the consolidated financial statements in crores? Additionally, could you point out the page number where this information can be found in the annual report as of 31st March 2024?"

Please note that I couldn't find the answer initially because I didn't have access to the specific annual report. If you provide me with more context or clarify which company's financial statements you are referring to, I would be happy to help you find the information.

Saving following answer :  The consolidated statement of profit and loss shows a net loss of ₹629.36 crore for the year ended 31 March 2024.  This information is found on page 158 of the annual report.My apologies, I still need the actual annual report to answer your question.  I cannot access external files or specific websites to get the information.  To help me find the profit information from the consolidated financial statements, please provide me with:


1. **The name of the company:** This will allow me to search for the correct annual report.
2. **A copy of the annual report (or at least the relevant page):**  Even a picture of the consolidated financial statement page would be helpful.


Once I have this information, I can accurately extract the profit in crores and provide the page number.

 Here is what Gemini got :  Based on the provided Annual Report of PC Jeweller Limited as of 31st March 2024, the voting rights of promoters are mentioned on **page 110**.  The report states that as of that date, Mr. Balram Garg held 43.89% of the equity shares, and Mrs. Krishna Devi held 10.41%, totaling 54.3% of the shares.

The report does **not** explicitly describe any pyramidal holding structures.  Therefore, based solely on the provided document, there is no information to suggest that the company uses such structures to disproportionately increase the voting power of its promoters.


Attempting guardrail checks

Guardrail response :  Here is my assessment of the LLM's answer:

{"got_answer": "yes", 
"source_mentioned": "yes"}

The LLM did get an answer to the question, and it mentioned the page number where the information was found (page 110). The answer also provides relevant information about the promoters' voting rights and does not suggest any pyramidal holding structures.

However, I would like to highlight that the LLM's answer could be improved by being more explicit and detailed. For instance, instead of simply stating that "the report states" something, it could provide a direct quote from the annual report page 110. Additionally, while the LLM correctly concluded that there is no information suggesting pyramidal holding structures, it would have been helpful if they had provided more context or justification for this conclusion.

Overall, I would give the LLM's answer a score of 8 out of 10 in terms of its reliability and faithfulness to the original question.

While the report lists subsidiaries and their percentage shareholding, it does not provide sufficient information to determine with certainty who the ultimate beneficial owner(s) are.

Okay, asking Gemini...

 Here is what Gemini got :  The provided document set does not contain a specific policy dedicated solely to the prevention of occupation-related injuries, accidents, and illnesses.  However, the **Business Responsibility Policy** from PC Jeweller Limited mentions this as a principle within a broader framework of corporate social responsibility.  The relevant section states (source: PC Jeweller Limited Business Responsibility Policy):


>PRINCIPLE 2: SAFETY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF GOODS

>The Company is engaged in the business of manufacturing, sale and trading of jewellery, which
>is safe for use and do not cause any harm to the customers.  [....] The Company shall ensure that its
>jewellery comply with all applicable standards.  The social, environmental and economic factors,
>wherever applicable, shall be taken into account while conducting its business.


While this doesn't detail specific programs or measures, it indicates that safety considerations are integrated into their business practices, implying an indirect focus on preventing occupational hazards.  More detailed information on prevention strategies would require accessing additional company documents or internal resources beyond what's available in this document set.

The LLM did not provide a definitive answer, as it correctly stated that there was no explicit mention of extending health, safety, and welfare policies to suppliers and vendors. This is because the policy in question (Business Responsibility Policy) does not detail specific provisions for them.

The LLM did mention the source (PC Jeweller Limited's website), which is a requirement for reliability.

Let's take another look at the company website policies. 

Okay, asking Gemini...

Saving following answer :  Based on the provided text extracted from PC Jeweller Limited's website, there is no explicit mention of the company's health, safety, and welfare policies extending to their suppliers and vendors.  While the Business Responsibility Policy mentions the company's commitment to ethical conduct and stakeholder engagement, including suppliers, it doesn't detail specific health, safety, and welfare provisions for them.  Therefore, I cannot definitively answer your question using only the provided source material.
Based on the provided text, there is **no explicit mention** of whether PC Jeweller's health, safety, and welfare policies extend to their suppliers and vendors.  The document mentions a commitment to providing a safe and healthy working environment *within* the company (Section 4.6, Health, Safety & Environment) and to conducting business in an environmentally responsible manner. However, neither this nor any other section explicitly states that these standards apply to their supply chain.

To definitively answer your question, a review of PC Jeweller's internal policy documents beyond those provided would be necessary.  The available text only focuses on internal company conduct and does not address external relationships with suppliers and vendors in terms of health, safety, and welfare.

Okay, asking Gemini...

 Here is what Gemini got :  Yes, the PC Jeweller Limited Annual Report (as of 31st March 2024) states that the company has a policy against sexual harassment, in accordance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, and related rules.  The report mentions that an Internal Complaints Committee is in place for addressing such complaints.  However, the report also states that no complaints were received during the year under review. (Page 13).

The provided text does *not* give the specific name of the policy.

{"got_answer": "no", 
"source_mentioned": "yes"}

The LLM did not get the answer correctly as it failed to provide the specific name of the policy. Although, it mentioned the source (PC Jeweller Limited Annual Report) and page number (Page 13). 

However, according to the question, the requirement was to find the name of the policy, which is not fulfilled by the LLM's answer. Therefore, it does not do justice to the question.

We are using following modified query  I understand your concern. It seems that I was unable to find the desired information in the annual report as of 31st March 2024.

To rephrase the question, I would like to ask:

"Can you please provide me with information on the company's policies and mechanisms regarding sexual harassment at the workplace? Additionally, are there any records or incidents mentioned in the report regarding sexual harassment, and if so, how does the company handle such incidents?"

I will make sure to quote the source correctly if I find the information.

I apologize for the previous responses.  I do not have access to external websites or specific files online, including the PC Jeweller Limited annual report. Therefore, I cannot provide you with details on their sexual harassment policies and any reported incidents.

To find this information, you will need to:

1. **Access the PC Jeweller Limited Annual Report:**  You can usually find this on their investor relations page on their website. Look for a section on "Corporate Governance," "Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report," or "Statutory Reports."  These sections often contain details about policies and procedures related to workplace conduct, including sexual harassment.

2. **Review the relevant sections:** Look for details on the company's policy, complaint mechanisms, any reported incidents, and how those incidents were handled.  Pay close attention to the language used; sometimes, the information may be presented indirectly.

3. **Contact the company directly:** If you can't find the information in the annual report, you can contact PC Jeweller Limited's investor relations department or their compliance officer.  They may be able to provide further details.


Remember to always cite the specific page numbers and section titles from the annual report when quoting information.

Okay, asking Gemini...

 Here is what Gemini got :  Based on the provided text extracted from PC Jeweller Limited's website, there is no specific policy dedicated solely to supplier/vendor selection or management.  Therefore, a direct answer to whether they have such policies in place cannot be definitively provided from this source.

However, some information related to supplier interactions can be gleaned from different policies:

**Hints about Supplier Interactions (No dedicated policy):**

* **Business Responsibility Policy:** This policy mentions the company's commitment to sustainable development and fulfilling social, environmental and economic responsibilities.  While not explicitly detailing supplier selection, it implies a consideration of ethical and sustainable practices which might indirectly influence supplier choices.  The policy states that the company strives to minimize waste and recycle resources, and that its jewellery complies with all applicable standards. These points suggest that suppliers may be expected to meet certain standards relating to sustainability and ethical sourcing.


**Verdict:**

Based solely on the provided documents from PC Jeweller Limited's website, there is no evidence of a dedicated policy explicitly outlining supplier/vendor selection *criteria* or a comprehensive supplier/vendor *management* policy. While the Business Responsibility Policy hints at some considerations influencing supplier interactions regarding sustainability and ethical conduct,  detailed selection criteria and management protocols are not available in the provided text.

Guardrail response :  Here is my assessment of the LLM's answer:

{"got_answer": "no", "source_mentioned": "yes"}

The LLM did not provide a direct answer to whether PC Jeweller Limited has policies for supplier/vendor selection and management, which was the main question asked. Instead, it analyzed different policies on the company website and found hints about supplier interactions in the Business Responsibility Policy.

While the LLM's analysis is correct, I would have liked to see more concrete evidence of specific policies or standards mentioned in the answer. The fact that the LLM did not mention page numbers or section numbers from which it obtained the information makes the answer less reliable.

Overall, while the LLM's attempt to analyze the company website is commendable, the answer could be improved by providing more direct and concrete evidence of specific policies or standards related to supplier/vendor selection and management.

We are using following modified query  I've searched the company's website and was unable to find specific policies or standards related to supplier/vendor selection and management. It appears that the company does not publicly disclose its policies in this regard.

However, I can suggest a revised query that might be more effective:

"Can you provide information on [Company Name]'s approach to selecting and managing suppliers/vendors? Are there any publicly available guidelines or policies that outline the criteria for evaluating and working with third-party vendors?"

This revised query is more open-ended and allows for the possibility of receiving general information about the company's practices, rather than expecting specific policy names.

That's an excellent revised query.  It's much more likely to elicit useful information than a query that assumes the existence of specific, publicly available documents.  The open-ended nature allows for a broader range of responses, including:

* **General descriptions of their vendor selection process:**  This could include criteria like financial stability, quality control, ethical sourcing, and environmental standards, even if not formally codified in a published policy.
* **Mention of internal guidelines or codes of conduct:**  Even if not publicly accessible, the response might acknowledge the existence of internal documents that guide supplier relationships.
* **Links to relevant sections of their annual report or sustainability reports:** These reports sometimes contain high-level information about supply chain management.
* **An explanation of why they don't publicly disclose such policies:** This could be due to competitive reasons or the nature of their internal processes.
* **A contact for further inquiries:**  The response may direct you to a specific department or individual who can provide more detailed information.

The revised query is a significant improvement because it focuses on obtaining information *about* their practices, rather than simply locating specific documents.  This approach is far more pragmatic when dealing with companies that may not publicly share all of their internal policies.

Okay, asking Gemini...

 Here is what Gemini got :  Based on the provided annual report for PC Jeweller Limited as of March 31, 2023, the company had several instances of delayed repayments to lenders, creditors, and suppliers.  The report indicates that these were largely due to ongoing legal disputes and resulting liquidity issues.

Here's a breakdown based on the provided documents:

**Lenders:**

* **Page 11:** The report states that lenders classified the company's accounts as Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) due to default/non-payment of debt/interest.  The company disputes this classification and has taken legal action.  The lenders also initiated legal proceedings for debt recovery.
* **Page 12:** The company mentions further legal action by State Bank of India (SBI) and other lenders in Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) for recovery of dues. The matter is sub-judice.


**Creditors:**

* **Page 15:** The independent auditor's report notes that the company had outstanding trade receivables (amounts owed by customers) of over ₹1,707 crores as of March 31, 2023, a portion of which is overdue.  The auditor indicates uncertainty regarding the recoverability of these receivables.

**Suppliers:**

* **Page 130:** The notes to the financial statements, specifically note 43, details the principal amount and interest due to suppliers which remains unpaid.  The amount listed is ₹1.85 crore as of March 31, 2023. The company attributes this to delays in payments to small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).


It's important to note that the company's financial statements contain multiple references to legal disputes with lenders impacting their ability to make timely payments.  The exact amounts and specific timelines of all delayed payments are not fully clarified due to the ongoing legal proceedings and the complexities involved.
